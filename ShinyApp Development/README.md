# Shinyapp Project

This aim of this project is to develop an app for doing analysis between products sold by different e-commerce platforms.

An image classification model (VGG16) has been added as a form of search engine. (It is trained with Kaggle GPU)

Apart from data visualisation, unsupervised learning techniques have also been applied as a form of data imputation for missing values.
