The video, which was posted on YouTube on Wednesday, appears to be from the same group that carried out the attacks in 2011. It's not clear if the video is authentic, but it's believed to have come from AQAP, a group linked to Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP) and the Islamic State.\n","– Cambridge Analytica, a data firm that worked for President Donald Trump’s 2016 campaign, is shutting down following allegations about its misuse of Facebook data and the campaign tactics it pitched to clients. The news comes after the company suspended its chief executive, Alexander Nix, and said it was launching an independent investigation to determine if the firm engaged in any wrongdoing in its work on political campaigns. \"We have reached out to the board determined that it is no longer viable to continue operating the business, which left the CEO and company's offerings in the current environment is \"futile,\" reports Gizmodo.\n","– The N.S.A. is a spy agency, and it's not the only one. The agency's eavesdropping operations have been a boon for the United States, which has been accused of spying on foreign leaders for years. In one case, the agency eavesdropped on a meeting between President Obama and the head of Iran's intelligence agency. But in another, it was a bit of a letdown, reports the New York Times. \"The agency is being browbeaten for doing too well the things it’s supposed to do,” says one former NSC official. “We probably dwarf everybody on the planet, just about, with perhaps the exception of Russia and China.“\n","– The story of a big Native American town in Kansas is finally being told, thanks to a high school kid who found a half-inch iron cannonball in his backyard. The discovery of Etzanoa in Arkansas City, Kansas, is the second-biggest in the United States, reports the Wichita Times-Picayune. It's the site of an epic battle fought in 1601 between the Spanish army and a tribe enemy to the Kansas people. A group of about 20,000 people were killed in that battle, according to an archaeologist at Wichita State University, who says the town was once a cluster of 30 little villages, then pushed aside by American settlers and the U.S. Army. \"We would have some concern about how they go about developing their thinking about the region, and for 50 years and more down the road.

The story of Weiner’s political career hasn't yet reached its conclusion, but the onetime protagonist is now cast as the antagonist.\n","– Magic Leap CEO Tannen Campbell is suing the company for sex discrimination, retaliation, and hostile work environment. In a lawsuit filed in Florida, Campbell alleges that she was asked to put together a presentation to highlight the lack of gender diversity at the startup. She says she brought up a PowerPoint presentation that outlined a \"female brain trust initiative\" (or FBI) that didn't accurately reflect what the product could actually do. The company's chief executive, Rony Abovitz, told Campbell to \"help with the pink/blue\" problem, according to a Business Insider article. Campbell, who was hired in April 2015, says the presentation was \"ignored in favor of her male colleagues’ assertions that the images and videos presented on the website and on YouTube were 'aspirational.'\" Campbell says that in her first few months at Orlando, she had to work on marketing material that was not accurately representative of the technology it promised to deliver. \"All the engineers and others in the office with glass doors, Old People and Ovaries were to produce a version in pink,\" she says.\n","– A new study suggests that the 2D:4D ratio may be an effective predictor of schizophrenia--there were significant differences between schizophrenia and control groups concerning the length of the second digit to the fourth digit, as well as its asymmetry, in both hands. The researchers found that when the index finger is shorter than the ring finger, this results in a small 2-to-4-diameter ratio, which suggests a high exposure to androgens (mostly testosterone) during the early fetal stage is essential for the development of male brain development. \"Asymmetry index showed moderate discriminatory power and, therefore asymmetric index has a potential utility as a diagnostic test in determining the presence of schizophrenic symptoms,\" says Dr. Taner Oznur, co-author of a study of 103 male patients diagnosed with schizophrenia, and 100 matched healthy male individuals, who were admitted to a university hospital between October 2012 and May 2013. All parametric data in the groups were compared using an independent t‐test to determine the predictive power of an AI, left, right, or right 1D/2D AI. There was no correlation between left 2nd digit and the SANS score. However, there was a negative correlation among left 1st digit (L2nd) and right 2d (3D):4, indicating the severity of negative symptoms.\n","– A 71-year-old Houston man is suing United Airlines for more than $1 million after he was pushed to the floor during an argument over a flight ticket, reports the Houston Chronicle. The man, Ronald Tigner, says the incident happened July 21, 2015, at George Bush Intercontinental Airport in Houston, Texas, and an employee pushed him down the aisle and off the plane in front of horrified passengers. \"This is just one of the most inhumane things I've ever seen in my life,\" he says in the lawsuit, which was obtained and broadcast Tuesday evening by Houston news station KPRC. A United employee, Alejandro Anastasia, is also named as a defendant.\n","– Stand-up comedians have long joked that some things, like the actual components of chicken nuggets, are better left mysterious. But a new study from Mississippi researchers found that two nugget samples from two national fast food chains in Jackson, Mississippi, contained 50 percent or less chicken muscle tissue, the breast or thigh meat that comes to mind when a customer thinks of \"chicken.\" The study, published in the American Journal of Medicine, shows that chicken is mostly fat, and its name is a misnomer. \"It's a very healthy product—lean, white meat—and processed it, goo-ed it up with fats, sugar and salt [in the breading],\" says the study's lead author, Dr. Ashley Peterson, who was not part of the research team. The nugs came from the first restaurant, which is where the researchers first noticed the difference between the two samples, Peterson told Reuters Health. It's \"not like super glue that we're eating. In some fast-food restaurants.\"\n","– A former sheriff in Colorado is facing charges of offering meth to a man for sex, reports the Denver Post. Patrick Sullivan Jr., 68, was arrested on suspicion of selling drugs to an unidentified man in a home in Centennial on Oct. 4, police say. Sullivan, who served as sheriff from 1984 to 2002, is accused of trying to get his roommates back into drugs and selling it only if they had sex with him, according to court documents. He was booked at a local county jail that proudly bears his name.\n","– Hillary Clinton is not afraid to talk about the Republican presidential race, but she's not shy about it. During an MSNBC town hall in Springfield, Illinois, on Monday, the former secretary of state chatted it up with host Chris Matthews about New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie's political future and his motivations for endorsing Donald Trump. \"I just happen to believe that in this moment of history, given the crises that we face, it is too late for establishment politics and establishment economics,\" Clinton told Matthews. She added that she holds Trump responsible for the violence seen in recent days at his rallies, and believes his rhetoric is \"dangerous.\" \"He's been building this incitement,\" she said.\n","– It's been a long time since we've seen a backlash against the TSA and body scanners, and it's only getting worse. In the wake of the 9/11 attacks, the Washington Post's Dana Milbank reports that a \"hysteria\" has been brewing in the Senate over the new security measures, which are being used to screen airport passengers for explosives hidden under clothing. \"It's a lagging reaction to the fact that Republicans no longer have to toe the party line on homeland security,\" she writes. The Wall Street Journal notes that the backlash is \"not something conservatives believed in deeply\" and that Democrats have been trying to weaken Americans' security for years.\n","– A new study shows that low-carb diets can help lower the risk of heart attacks and strokes. Researchers at Tulane University in New Orleans found that when people stopped eating so many refined carbohydrates, they burned off about 150 more calories per day, compared to those eating a higher carb, lower-fat diet. The study, published in the Journal of the American Medical Association, showed that modest reductions in carbohydrate consumption, down to about 28 to 30 percent of diet, could help tip the scales to weight loss. \"We saw improvements in triglycerides, [good] cholesterol, and the possibility of lower chronic inflammation,\" says the study's lead author, Lydia Bazzano.\n","– Sprint is in a touchy spot because it has a higher base of smartphone customers than its rivals--roughly half of its total customers. Sprint will begin selling the iPhone 5 in mid-October, according to two people familiar with the matter. \"It not only is likely to give Sprint a boost but also puts more focus on the increasing importance of device suppliers relative to carriers,\" one of the people said, per the Wall Street Journal. The iPhone 4, which is expected to be called \"iPhone 5,\" will hit the market later than expected and too late to contribute to sales in Apple's fiscal fourth quarter, the Journal reports. It's unclear just how many new subscribers Sprint may be able to reel in come this fall, but it's part of a broader trend of telecommunication companies struggling to keep up with growing bandwidth consumption.\n","– The 65th Primetime Emmy Awards telecast, hosted by Neil Patrick Harris, was a bit of a letdown. It was, in a word, a \"black hole\" in the Emmys' awards-show viewing experience, with a few memorable moments that left some viewers feeling like they were being cheated out of an Emmy. The first-ever Emmy win for \"Modern Family\" went to the winner of the award for best comedy, and the second-best performance by a cast member of \"Breaking Bad\" was to be given a special tribute. \"Thank you so much. I gotta go.

The survey, led by University of Michigan Associate Professor of Psychology Terri Conley, found that heterosexuals in open or polyamorous relationships reported high levels of satisfaction, trust, and passionate love, as well as a low level of jealousy. \"Overall, the outcomes are the same - indicating no net benefit of one relationship style over another,\" says the study's lead author.\n","– A Georgia sheriff's deputy was shot and killed by a gunman at the Forsyth County Courthouse in Cumming, Ga., on Friday morning, reports the Atlanta Journal-Constitution. The deputy, who was on his way to a separate incident, was the only person wounded in the shooting. \"The only way I can describe it is in a frontal assault on our court house,\" says the sheriff. He was armed with gas grenades, assault rifle, and spike strips, but none were booby-trapped to go off.\n"],"name":"stdout"}]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"0CFE1eL1Otyz","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1629731424942,"user_tz":-480,"elapsed":5,"user":{"displayName":"Lin Qiwei","photoUrl":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AOh14Gg7Y5XhKXvLeCQIWyx0AC4rGepdGbRR1Wm8LkA61A=s64","userId":"12577342240101728853"}},"outputId":"15671aa5-b46d-43d1-b81a-e64c4351f76b"},"source":["rouge_output = rouge.compute(\n","    predictions=result[\"predicted\"], references=result[\"summary\"][:max_target_length], rouge_types=[\"rouge2\"]\n",")[\"rouge2\"].mid\n","\n","print({\n","    \"rouge2_precision\": round(rouge_output.precision, 4),\n","    \"rouge2_recall\": round(rouge_output.recall, 4),\n","    \"rouge2_fmeasure\": round(rouge_output.fmeasure, 4),\n","})"],"execution_count":13,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","text":["{'rouge2_precision': 0.1559, 'rouge2_recall': 0.0864, 'rouge2_fmeasure': 0.1089}\n"],"name":"stdout"}]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"NN6rcEVAlfVo","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1629731923186,"user_tz":-480,"elapsed":819,"user":{"displayName":"Lin Qiwei","photoUrl":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AOh14Gg7Y5XhKXvLeCQIWyx0AC4rGepdGbRR1Wm8LkA61A=s64","userId":"12577342240101728853"}},"outputId":"af4af976-fce1-4b2f-e149-e36fa994c1ca"},"source":["eval_dataset['document']"],"execution_count":11,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["['Whether a sign of a good read; or a comment on the \\'pulp\\' nature of some genres of fiction, the Oxfam second-hand book charts have remained in The Da Vinci Code author\\'s favour for the past four years. \\n  \\n Dan Brown has topped Oxfam\\'s \\'most donated\\' list again, his fourth consecutive year.

Knopf Doubleday is a division of Random House Inc. \\n  \\n Amazon.com Inc, the world\\'s largest online retailer, called the book its bestselling first-day adult fiction title ever, including pre-orders. \\n  \\n Barnes & Noble Inc said \"The Lost Symbol\" broke its previous one-day sales record for adult fiction. \\n  \\n The success of the Dan Brown\\'s latest is a boost to publisher Knopf Doubleday and booksellers, which have endured sliding sales in the midst of the recession. \\n  \\n Booksellers have anxiously awaited a popular title that will resonate with readers and fuel the same sort of frenzy seen earlier this decade with the \"Harry Potter\" series, from author J.K. Rowling. \\n  \\n But the $25 billion domestic book market has wallowed in a slump in recent years as more readers make their purchases online, or forego books altogether for online games and other forms of media and entertainment. \\n  \\n Now, digital books and electronic reading devices such as Amazon\\'s Kindle or Sony Corp\\'s Reader are seen as both avenues of growth and sources of competition for traditional media, and publishers and booksellers are scrambling to respond. \\n  \\n The highly anticipated book from Brown comes six years after the release of the American novelist\\'s last book \"The Da Vinci Code\". It follows the adventures of Harvard professor Robert Langdon and is set in the secret world of Freemasons in Washington D.C. \\n  \\n \"The Da Vinci Code\" sold 80 million copies worldwide. It was made into a film starring Tom Hanks that grossed more than $758 million, according to tracking firm Box Office Mojo. \\n  \\n Shares of Amazon closed up $7.15 to $90.70 on the Nasdaq.

With just four books to his name – although his long-awaited fifth The Lost Symbol is published next month – Brown did well to see off competition from John Grisham, author of more than 20 and the second-most likely writer to be ditched in a charity shop by readers. \\n  \\n But as secondhand bookshop shelves flood with battered editions of Angels and Demons and Digital Fortress, Brown can comfort himself with the fact that he\\'s also Oxfam\\'s second most bought author: there are, apparently, still readers out there who have yet to follow the adventures of the dapper symbologist Robert Langdon. There\\'s no such consolation for Grisham, whose legal thrillers fail to make Oxfam\\'s bestseller charts at all. \\n  \\n \"There\\'s no question that when you go into the back room of Oxfam shops there are many Dan Brown books,\" said Oxfam\\'s director of trading David McCullough. \"But he\\'s also very high on the bestseller list so there is a useful recycling exercise going on – it\\'s not just people saying \\'I\\'ve read The Da Vinci Code and now I must get rid of it\\'.\" \\n  \\n Ian Rankin, whose dour, boozy detective John Rebus is no Robert Langdon, tops Oxfam\\'s bestseller list, which the charity says is the first ever high-street secondhand bestseller chart. \"It\\'s always good for an author to know that their books are popular,\" said the Scottish author, who will unveil a new policeman hero, the teetotal Malcolm Fox, next month. \"With Oxfam, it\\'s also heartening to realise that each book donated and bought is helping such a worthwhile organisation.\" \\n  \\n Stephenie Meyer, author of the Twilight series and instigator of myriad teenage crushes courtesy of her sparkly vampire hero Edward Cullen, is also sitting high in Oxfam\\'s charts, nestling between Bernard Cornwell and Terry Pratchett. \\n  \\n Margaret Atwood, meanwhile, winner of the Booker prize and author of a host of critically acclaimed works of fiction, scrapes into the list in eighth place, keeping unlikely company with thriller powerhouse James Patterson – currently producing at least eight books a year thanks to a horde of co-writers – and Jodi Picoult, never afraid to jerk a tear or pile on the plot twists. \\n  \\n \"We just need to dispel the idea that we are sitting there in Oxfam with only first editions of literary gems – actually we\\'ve got shelves of really good fiction,\" said McCullough. \"Waterstone\\'s might be more upset than secondhand booksellers,\" he added, referring to the recent slew of complaints from secondhand booksellers that the charity is stealing their business. \\n  \\n Oxfam, Europe\\'s biggest high-street retailer of secondhand books and the third-biggest bookseller in the UK, launched a drive for book donations in May ahead of its first national book festival, Bookfest, in July.

Those courageous enough to go into battle should face zero delays in getting the education benefits they’ve earned. \\n  \\n Unfortunately, financial aid has been late or gone AWOL this fall for thousands of veterans and their families relying on the GI Bill to get through school. The reason: a big information-technology glitch that surfaced with what seemed like a relatively minor change in how the aid is calculated. \\n  \\n While the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) is trying to fix this, a lack of communication by the agency about the delays, coupled with inaction by the U.S. Senate, has left service members-turned-students facing severe financial hardships. This week, the agency was still working to process more than 58,000 student aid claims. \\n  \\n On Wednesday, the VA announced that the information technology fixes will not be completed until December 2019 — more than a year past the original Aug. 1 deadline for finishing this work. This is a national disgrace, one that should prompt congressional leadership to move quickly on short- and long-term solutions. A good start would be swift passage of a Senate bill that would prohibit schools from penalizing student veterans for late VA assistance payments. This would address a major concern that students with accounts in arrears due to delayed payments may not be allowed to enroll for 2019 coursework. Given that the VA has said the tech problems will continue until the end of 2019, this protection is a sensible step. \\n  \\n The House merits praise for unanimously passing hold-students-harmless legislation, which has been dubbed the “SIT-REP” bill. But the legislation is bogged down in the Senate. \\n  \\n “If ever there was a time that it was obvious this bill needed to be passed, now is the time,” said Tanya Ang, vice president of the Veterans Education Success organization, in a statement provided for a Nov. 15 House Veterans Affairs subcommittee hearing. \\n  \\n Other testimony provided at the hearing made it clear that long-term solutions are urgently needed, too. The VA has lacked a permanent chief information officer since January 2017, which is unacceptable given how technology is so critical to delivering service members’ benefits. \\n  \\n President Donald Trump nominated a well-qualified Minnesota native, James Gfrerer, last summer, but the Senate has yet to confirm him. The Senate is expected to take this up soon, but the delay is inexcusable. \\n  \\n Both houses of Congress also need to scrutinize a much larger problem — the antiquated IT systems relied on by the VA and other federal agencies. A statement provided to the House by Booz Allen Hamilton, the private contractor originally hired to update the VA system, makes clear the root of the GI Bill problem: “The unfortunate delay has been caused by the confluence of outdated systems being asked to perform ever complex tasks.” \\n  \\n A 2016 Government Accountability Office report put the age of the VA’s benefits delivery platform at more than a half century. At that time, other agencies, such as the Treasury Department, also had so-called “legacy systems” in that age range. “Many use outdated software and hardware parts that are unsupported,” the report warned. \\n  \\n The GI Bill delay shows how a tweak to these dated systems can be complicated and time-consuming. There’s likely little appetite in Congress to tackle the daunting task of modernization, but leadership is sorely needed. ||||| Breaking News Emails Get breaking news alerts and special reports. The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings. \\n  \\n Nov. 29, 2018, 1:40 AM GMT / Updated Nov. 29, 2018, 1:52 AM GMT By Phil McCausland \\n  \\n For weeks, student veterans across the country have raised an alarm about delayed or incorrect GI Bill benefit payments, which the Department of Veterans Affairs has blamed on computer issues. \\n  \\n But on Wednesday, the department told congressional staffers that it would not reimburse those veterans who were paid less than they were owed, two committee aides told NBC News. \\n  \\n The news conflicts with a promise VA officials made to a House committee earlier this month that it would reimburse those veterans who received less than the full amount they were due. \\n  \\n According to the aides, however, the VA said it could not make retroactive payments without auditing its previous education claims, which it said would delay future claims. The aides asked not to be identified because they were not authorized to speak publicly. \\n  \\n NBC News previously reported that some veterans were forced into desperate financial straits stemming from a change in calculating housing allowances under the Forever GI Bill, which President Donald Trump signed into law in July 2017. When its computers were unable to process that change, the VA quickly faced a backlog of veterans’ claims three times higher than normal. \\n  \\n Because of those issues, the VA had announced earlier on Wednesday that it would delay the Forever GI Bill housing allowance changes until December 2019 — and again promised that retroactive payments would be made to those who did not receive a correct amount. \\n  \\n But VA officials told congressional staffers in a telephone call on Wednesday morning that once the system is made right next year, they will not make retroactive payments to those who were underpaid because of the housing miscalculations. \\n  \\n \"They are essentially going to ignore the law and say that that change only goes forward from December 2019,\" one aide told NBC News. \\n  \\n The reason the VA decided that it would not make the retroactive payments is because it would have to audit all its previous education claims prior to December 2019, meaning the VA would potentially have to inspect 2 million claims, the aide said. \\n  \\n VA officials said this could cause further delays in processing future claims, according to the aides, an issue that caused some veterans to suffer earlier this year. \\n  \\n While this decision could mean the agency is flouting the law because it would not provide the correct amount of money to student veterans as required by two sections of the Forever GI Bill, the VA told the congressional staffers that they have a legal justification that would allow them to move forward with this decision. \\n  \\n They did not share that justification, however. \\n  \\n When asked for comment, a VA spokesman did not address the issue directly. Instead he reiterated that the agency would delay paying housing allowances in accordance with the new Forever GI Bill until the spring term of 2020 and instead pay housing allowances based on Department of Defense\\'s older Basic Housing Allowance rates. \\n  \\n Attempting to implement the law would put “an enormous administrative burden for schools in which some 35,000 certifying officials would have to track retroactively and re-certify hundreds of thousands of enrollment documents,” Curtis Cashour, the VA spokesman, said over email. \\n  \\n Cashour also said that students who were overpaid because of the law’s changes or because of issues in implementing the law “will not be held liable for the debt.” \\n  \\n But he did not comment on those who were underpaid and rampant confusion continues to surround the issue, as it is unknown how many students have been underpaid thus far, how many more could be underpaid because of the changes to the law and how much money these veterans are owed. \\n  \\n Congressional aides described the situation as “frustrating.” One, who commented on the shifting answers and constant confusion stemming from VA, asked, “I mean, am I taking crazy pills?” \\n  \\n Under Secretary for Benefits Paul Lawrence is scheduled to testify Thursday morning before the House Committee on Veterans’ Affairs. \\n  \\n One of the committee aides said that members of Congress will attempt to clear this issue up before they move forward with the hearing. \\n  \\n “They need to figure it out,” the aide said. ||||| After blowing through the initial deadline to bring its GI Bill housing stipends in line with the Forever GI Bill law, Veterans Affairs Department officials said Wednesday that they will not be able to implement the fix until December 2019. \\n  \\n The big delay comes after months of technology hiccups that have plagued the agency, which failed to meet the original Aug. 1 deadline to put the changes in place. These problems have contributed to a backlog of claims for veterans using the Post-9/11 GI Bill to attend school this fall, and the agency has come under fire in recent months as thousands of student veterans have had to wait longer than usual for their tuition and housing payments. \\n  \\n “Redesigning the way (Veterans Benefits Administration) calculates Post-9/11 GI Bill housing rates during a busy academic season was like flying a plane while building it, and that was unfair and frustrating to veterans and taxpayers. That’s why we are resetting our implementation of the law for the next year to ensure we get the technology and formula right to put Veterans first,” VA Sec. Robert Wilkie said in a news release. “In the meantime, beneficiaries receiving Post 9/11 GI Bill housing allowances will be paid at the DoD (basic housing allowance) rate, which in many cases will be equal to or higher than their current payment.” \\n  \\n Rebootcamp Recommendations \\n  \\n Congressional leaders who have taken the VA to task for the slow implementation said Wednesday they are glad Wilkie is choosing to focus on getting student veterans their payments, even if it means pushing back the deadline for the IT updates to be completed. \\n  \\n “While I am disappointed that the VA does not yet have an effective IT system in place, I understand Secretary Wilkie’s decision to reset implementation of certain sections of the ‘Forever’ GI Bill while improvements continue to be made,” Senate Committee on Veterans’ Affairs Chairman Sen. Johnny Isakson, R-Ga., said in a statement. “Right now, the VA’s priority must be to ensure accurate payments are sent to student veterans in a timely manner. Student veterans rely on the GI Bill to support themselves and their families while they are in school, and the VA is responsible for keeping those payments going, even as it implements the new law.” \\n  \\n Rep. Phil Roe, R-Tenn., whose House Committee on Veterans Affairs’ pressed VA leaders for a new deadline in a hearing on Capitol Hill earlier this month, said Wilkie’s move “will ensure that monthly housing payments are made with minimal delays.” \\n  \\n Both lawmakers said they would continue their efforts to hold the VA accountable. ||||| CLOSE Dr. Hilary Miller of MTSU works with veteran students on the GI Bill that are affected by VA technical difficulties Mark Zaleski and Michael Schwab \\n  \\n Staff Sergeant Robert Baker and his family have been affected by VA tech issues that has delayed GI Bill Benefits for months (Photo: Submitted) \\n  \\n Staff Sgt. Robert Baker was so stressed about money that he made a “spur of the moment decision” and dropped out of all his classes. \\n  \\n It was already October and he hadn’t received his GI Bill benefits for the start of his fall semester at Austin Peay State University in Clarksville. \\n  \\n The 30-year-old communications major and his wife, in her last semester of nursing school, are full-time students. At home, they have three young kids, ages 2 to 6. \\n  \\n “I freaked out,” Baker said in an interview with the USA TODAY NETWORK - Tennessee. “I told them I was going to fall behind on my mortgage. I was expecting to be paid by the VA, but since it wasn’t happening, I needed to get to work.” \\n  \\n His wife had already picked up a second job bartending to make ends meet. \\n  \\n “They’re too young to know about the money aspect, but they know mommy is gone so much,” Baker said of his kids, who he watches at alone at night after a day of classes. “They were feeling our stress.” \\n  \\n Baker left the Army this summer after 12 years in the service, including deployments to Iraq in 2008 and Kuwait in 2012. He was stationed in Fort Campbell for four years. \\n  \\n He wanted to take advantage of his GI Bill so he enrolled for classes just a month after the Army discharged him. But the money never came, he said. \\n  \\n \"We were just shocked. We were angry because we figured this would be automatic,\" Baker said. \"Come to find out, there were big problems going on at the VA.\" \\n  \\n There are many veterans, like Baker, in Tennessee and across the country who are still waiting for the Department of Veterans Affairs to clear a backlog created after President Donald Trump signed the Forever GI BIll in 2017. \\n  \\n While the landmark legislation expanded benefits for a new generation of veterans and their families, it didn’t upgrade the VA’s antiquated technical capabilities to account for those changes. \\n  \\n Problems are centered within the VA’s Office of Information Technology, which is tasked with implementing the change to how housing allowances are calculated, the VA said. \\n  \\n The new bill changed it so that veterans housing would be based on the school’s ZIP code, rather that where the veteran lived. Problems arose when the VA attempted to stress test their outdated system, as well as a contract dispute. As a result, the VA waited until July 16 to tell schools to begin enrolling students. \\n  \\n The delay caused a backlog of claims, meaning thousands of students had to wait for their benefits just as they were headed back to school for the fall semester. Post-Sept. 11 military-affiliated students, particularly first-time students like Baker, were mostly impacted. \\n  \\n On Nov. 14, state Rep. Jay Reedy, R-Erin, and leaders in the Tennessee House and Senate wrote a letter to U.S. Rep. Phil Roe, R-Johnson City, and members of the House Committee on Veterans Affairs urging them to take immediate action. Roe chairs the committee. \\n  \\n Nationally there are fewer than 1,000 Veterans who have an education claim that has been pending over 60 days and less than 10,000 who have a claim that’s been pending for over 30 days, as of Nov. 28, according to VA spokesman Curt Cashour. \\n  \\n Universities step in to help students \\n  \\n But where the VA failed, universities across the state have stepped up to help students. \\n  \\n Many schools are utilizing 0 percent interest loans and tuition deferment as ways to ensure student veterans receive the financial support they need continue their education. \\n  \\n As a result, institutional funds at several schools have been heavily drawn down, creating budget concerns. \\n  \\n Baker said after he dropped his classes, he came to the realization that he would have to pay the school back for the months he\\'s already been in class. \\n  \\n \"It was just going to hurt me more financially. I was freaking out and called admissions,\" he said. \"They said \\'It\\'s OK. We\\'ll fix it.\\'\" \\n  \\n APSU has some 2,400 military-affiliated students on campus, according to retired Brig. Gen. Scott Brower, who joined the institution this year as its first military adviser in residence. \\n  \\n About $960,000 in tuition was deferred by the university for students impacted by the delay, and 83 students have taken out short-term loans offered by the school, totaling $175,000, according to Brower. \\n  \\n \"We recognize this is on the VA and that they will fix this problem. We\\'ve been treating it with good faith, knowing that money is not available for them right now,\" he said. \"We want to make sure we are doing everything we can so that students are continuing on their goal for degree completion.\" \\n  \\n Middle Tennessee State University in Murfreesboro has done the same for its students, according to Hilary Miller, the director of the Daniels Center, a resource for the nearly 1,100 veterans and military families on campus. \\n  \\n “It was terrible,” she said, speaking of the delays. She said about 682 students receive post 9/11 benefits. \\n  \\n Buy Photo Middle Tennessee State University Veterans and Military Family Center director, Dr. Hilary Miller on Monday, Nov. 26, 2018, in Murfreesboro, Tenn.

(Photo: Mark Zaleski /For The Tennessean) \\n  \\n Miller said the school deferred their tuition and had short-term loans available for students to hold them over until their benefits had been processed. The school also had template letters for students to use with landlords explaining their situation. \\n  \\n “We asked our community members to extend grace to our veterans and that this was nothing the veterans did,” she said. \\n  \\n Students reached out to say that they couldn\\'t pay for books and that it impacted their productivity in the classroom. The school contacted staff and faculty to make sure they were aware of the situation and asked if they could make copies of textbook pages in certain cases. \\n  \\n \"We did everything we could do to make it easier, but if you\\'re not getting paid for a couple of months, there\\'s not a lot we can do to make it easier,\" Miller said. \\n  \\n VA\\'s \\'alarm\\' didn\\'t go off \\n  \\n The delays varied greatly for students at East Tennessee State University in Johnson City. Some students were processed within 72 hours, but in many cases, students had to wait months to see any money. \\n  \\n “We were calling a month later, then two months later and (the VA) said. ‘We meant to get to that,’” said Antonio Banchs, the director of veterans affairs at East Tennessee State. \\n  \\n “It was as if they put in an alarm clock or something,\" Banchs said. \"But it never went off.” \\n  \\n As of mid-November, Banchs said all of the roughly 1,000 veteran-affiliated students on campus had at last received their benefits. But it came with costs. \\n  \\n “Some were put in a financial hardship,” he said. “Especially our first-time students who went through a more rigorous process.” \\n  \\n Buy Photo Middle Tennessee State University Veterans and Military Family Center director, Dr. Hilary Miller talks with geo science student and former United State Marine Corps Sgt.

The institution also used the summer to train staff. \\n  \\n \"We started at that time really trying to ramp up what we are doing,\" Miller said. \"I think we mitigated a lot of the problem before it happened.\" \\n  \\n Ten students are left to be paid as of mid-November. Miller said she is concerned that nothing has changed for the new spring semester and that the VA hasn\\'t provided any clarity. \\n  \\n \"We\\'re not really sure what\\'s going to happen. From what we are hearing, it\\'s not resolved. There\\'s not a time in which they foresee it being resolved,\" she said. \\n  \\n \"The VA keeps saying nobody has dropped out.

This applied to the first enrollment in an educational program on or after August 1, 2018. \\n  \\n Changes to Licensing and Certification Charges \\n  \\n Entitlement charges for licensing and certification exams and national tests under the Post-9/11 GI Bill will be prorated based on the actual amount of the fee charged for the test. \\n  \\n Assistance for Students Affected by School Closures and Certain Disapprovals \\n  \\n VA is now authorized to restore benefits and provide relief to education beneficiaries affected by school closures or certain disapprovals. This means payments of educational assistance will not be charged against an entitlement of educational assistance, or counted against the total period for which a beneficiary may receive educational assistance under two or more programs, if VA finds that the individual was unable to complete such course or program of study as a result of: \\n  \\n the closure of an educational institution; or \\n  \\n  \\n  \\n  \\n  \\n the disapproval of the course or a course that is a necessary part of that program by reason of a new law, regulation, or policy implemented after the individual enrolls. \\n  \\n  \\n  \\n  \\n  \\n not receiving credit, or losing training time, toward completion of the program being pursued. \\n  \\n VA may treat a course of education that is disapproved under this chapter as being approved, if VA determines, on a case-by-case basis, that the course was disapproved for one of the reasons stated above and continuing the course is in the best interest of the individual \\n  \\n This provision takes effect 90 days after August 16, 2017 and applies to courses and programs of education discontinued after August 1, 2015. For courses or programs discontinued during the period beginning January 1, 2015, and ending on August 16, 2017, an individual who does not transfer credits can have all his/her entitlement restored. \\n  \\n VA may also continue awarding a monthly housing allowance stipend under the Post-9/11 GI Bill program following a permanent school closure or certain disapproval of a course of study.

AQAP has recently focused on fighting government forces and Shi\\'ite rebels in Yemen, but says it still aims to carry out attacks abroad. \\n  \\n AQAP mocked a huge rally of solidarity for the victims held in Paris on Sunday, saying the shock on display showed the feebleness of the Western leaders who attended. \\n  \\n \"Look at how they gathered, rallied and supported each other, strengthening their weakness and dressing their wounds,\" it said. \\n  \\n Al Qaeda offshoot Islamic State released a video that it said showed interviews with three French fighters in Syria praising the attacks, the SITE monitoring service reported. \\n  \\n One said: \"I say to the French people who think that the Islamic State will not reach Europe: With permission from Allah the Almighty, we will reach Europe – all of Europe.\" \\n  \\n \"JOY AT TORMENT\" \\n  \\n SITE also said Nigeria\\'s Boko Haram group had released a video showing its leader welcoming the attacks. “We have felt joy for what befell the people of France in terms of torment, as their blood was spilled inside their country. Allah is Great!\" Abubakar Shekau said in the recording, according to SITE. \\n  \\n One Western source described Ansi as an Al Qaeda hawk reputed to have advocated a merger with the even more hardline Islamic State. \\n  \\n Two senior Yemeni sources said Cherif and Said Kouachi had met Awlaki in Yemen and undergone weapons training in the eastern province of Marib. However, a Marib tribal leader denied that they had trained there in 2011 or that Awlaki had been based there. \\n  \\n AQAP\\'s Yemeni leader, Nasser al-Wuhayshi, was once a close associate of al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden, whose father was born in Yemen, a neighbor of Saudi Arabia. \\n  \\n Yemeni President Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi complained on Wednesday that Yemen had been subjected to a politicized media campaign over the alleged 2011 visit. \\n  \\n \"The person reported to have traveled to Yemen to learn in three days how to fire a pistol had been detained and under investigation for two years in France,\" Hadi said, according to the state news agency Saba. Hadi asked why such suspicious elements had been allowed to travel to Yemen and return home without being questioned. \\n  \\n (Reporting by Ahmed Tolba in Cairo, Yara Bayoumy in Dubai, Mohammed Ghobari in Sanaa and Lesley Wroughton and Doina Chiacu in Washington, Editing by William Maclean, Dominic Evans and Kevin Liffey) ||||| Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption The BBC\\'s Hugh Schofield reports from a kiosk in Paris as people queue to buy the latest issue \\n  \\n Millions more copies of French weekly Charlie Hebdo are being printed after the first run sold out in hours. \\n  \\n The normal print run of 60,000 was extended to five million - a week after Islamist gunmen murdered 12 people at the magazine\\'s offices and five others in subsequent attacks in Paris. \\n  \\n The \"survivors\\' issue\" has angered some Muslims by depicting the Prophet Muhammad on its cover. \\n  \\n A video purportedly from al-Qaeda in Yemen said it planned the Hebdo attack. \\n  \\n US state department spokeswoman Marie Harf said they believed the video was authentic but could not determine if its claims were true. \\n  \\n The group, AQAP, had previously welcomed the attack, without acknowledging any role in the operation. \\n  \\n The gunmen are said to have used earlier publication of images of the Prophet as justification for their attack on the magazine. \\n  \\n Charlie Hebdo\\'s latest cover shows a cartoon depicting the Prophet Muhammad weeping while holding a sign saying \"I am Charlie\", and below the headline \"All is forgiven\". \\n  \\n Image copyright Reuters Image caption People waited for kiosks to open to buy the magazine \\n  \\n Image copyright AP Image caption All copies of the magazine were sold out by Wednesday morning at this Paris newsstand \\n  \\n Image copyright AP Image caption Some kiosks said they had received dozens of reservation requests \\n  \\n \"I am Charlie\" emerged as a message of support for the magazine following the attack on 7 January, which left eight journalists, including its editor, dead in addition to four others. \\n  \\n In a separate attack in Paris two days later, an Islamist gunman killed four Jewish men and took hostages at a kosher shop. \\n  \\n The same attacker is believed to have shot a policewoman the day before. \\n  \\n \\'Charlie is alive\\' \\n  \\n Normally Charlie Hebdo prints 60,000 copies but the planned run increased steadily this week - from one million to three million to five million. \\n  \\n Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Charlie Hebdo editor-in-chief Gerard Biard comforted Renald \"Luz\" Luzier, who drew the latest cover, at a news conference \\n  \\n The \"survivors\\' issue\", as the magazine calls it, is available in six languages including English, Arabic and Turkish.

More than two years have elapsed since Said Kouachi, one of the three gunmen, is believed to have slipped out of Yemen after spending time there with al-Qaeda members, including the extremist preacher Anwar Al-Awlaki. \\n  \\n He is mentioned in the video in connection with the attack planning but Al-Awlaki was killed back in 2011 in a US drone strike so, again, that would be a long time to plan such a relatively simple but devastating attack. \\n  \\n It is also odd that AQAP have not issued any so-called \"martyrdom videos\", showing the perpetrators giving their justifications ahead of the raid. \\n  \\n These may still be to come but for now it seems the connection between the Paris attackers and AQAP is more one of inspiration, ideology and training rather than close direction and leadership. \\n  \\n Were gunmen aided by terror network? \\n  \\n Coulibaly had pledged allegiance to IS in a video message while the Charlie Hebdo attackers, Said and Cherif Kouachi, had said they were acting on behalf of AQAP. \\n  \\n Coulibaly had said they had co-ordinated the attacks but experts say it is highly unlikely IS and AQAP, rivals in the Middle East, would work together. \\n  \\n Meanwhile a lawyer for Said Kouachi\\'s wife, Soumya, has told the BBC she had no idea he was an extremist. He said Kouachi had kissed his wife goodbye and told her he was visiting his brother, because he was unwell, just hours before the Charlie Hebdo attack. \\n  \\n \"It\\'s beyond her understanding, her world has fallen apart,\" the lawyer, Antoine Flasaquier, said. \\n  \\n Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Soumya Kouachi\\'s lawyer: \"Her husband told her he was going to Paris to see his brother Cherif\" \\n  \\n Ban on distribution \\n  \\n The magazine\\'s release comes after millions - including dozens of world leaders - took part in a unity rally in Paris on Sunday. \\n  \\n Outside France, the Washington Post, Germany\\'s Frankfurter Allgemeine, Corriere della Sera in Italy and the UK\\'s Guardian are among publications that have shown the latest cartoon. \\n  \\n The BBC has published the image in a previous story and in a statement said: \"We have made the editorial judgment that the images are central to reporting the story.\" \\n  \\n Why people are buying the magazine \\n  \\n Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Why do Parisians say it is important to buy this issue of Charlie Hebdo? \\n  \\n Catherine Boniface, Paris: \"This issue is symbolic, it represents their persistence, they didn\\'t yield in the face of terror.\" \\n  \\n Read more: In the queue for Charlie Hebdo \\n  \\n Read more: Charlie Hebdo\\'s place in French journalism \\n  \\n Read more: The issue of depicting the Prophet Muhammad \\n  \\n Meanwhile, the interior minister of Senegal - whose president took part in the Paris march - has issued an order banning the distribution of the magazine, according to the national news agency. \\n  \\n Comedian arrested \\n  \\n Several hundred people attended the funeral on Wednesday of Michel Renaud, who was killed while visiting Charlie Hebdo\\'s offices. \\n  \\n Ceremonies were held for seven other victims in France and Israel on Tuesday. \\n  \\n Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption New mobile phone footage shows the Kouachi brothers opening fire on police \\n  \\n Meanwhile, controversial French comedian Dieudonne M\\'bala M\\'bala has been arrested for \"defending terrorism\" after he likened himself to gunman Amedy Coulibaly. \\n  \\n A judicial source quoted by AFP news agency said he was due to be released on Wednesday evening but would face trial at a later date. \\n  \\n Police are also investigating some 50 people suspected of \"condoning terrorism\" and 25 cases of people attacking or defacing Muslim places of worship. \\n  \\n How the attacks unfolded (all times GMT) \\n  \\n Wednesday 7 January 10:30 - Two masked gunmen enter Charlie Hebdo offices, killing 11 people, including the magazine\\'s editor.

Both Cambridge Analytica and SCL Elections (the SCL Group subsidiary connected to Cambridge Analytica) will now close their doors. \\n  \\n Advertisement \\n  \\n During the call, Wheatland said that the board determined that rebranding the company’s offerings in the current environment is “futile.” \\n  \\n Cambridge Analytica and the SCL Group have offices in London, New York City, Arlington, Virginia, and Washington, D.C. The conference call was originally scheduled for Tuesday morning, but was repeatedly pushed back until early Wednesday afternoon, ultimately getting rescheduled more than half a dozen times. \\n  \\n Screenshots from the company’s internal chat service obtained by Gizmodo show a darkly comic mood in anticipation of the call.

But with the attacks of September 2001 came a new sense of urgency. \\n  \\n When Ban Ki-moon, the United Nations secretary general, sat down with President Obama at the White House in April to discuss Syrian chemical weapons, Israeli-Palestinian peace talks and climate change , it was a cordial, routine exchange. \\n  \\n The National Security Agency nonetheless went to work in advance and intercepted Mr. Ban’s talking points for the meeting, a feat the agency later reported as an “operational highlight” in a weekly internal brag sheet. It is hard to imagine what edge this could have given Mr. Obama in a friendly chat, if he even saw the N.S.A.’s modest scoop. (The White House won’t say.) \\n  \\n But it was emblematic of an agency that for decades has operated on the principle that any eavesdropping that can be done on a foreign target of any conceivable interest — now or in the future — should be done. After all, American intelligence officials reasoned, who’s going to find out? \\n  \\n From thousands of classified documents, the National Security Agency emerges as an electronic omnivore of staggering capabilities, eavesdropping and hacking its way around the world to strip governments and other targets of their secrets, all the while enforcing the utmost secrecy about its own operations. It spies routinely on friends as well as foes, as has become obvious in recent weeks; the agency’s official mission list includes using its surveillance powers to achieve “diplomatic advantage” over such allies as France and Germany and “economic advantage” over Japan and Brazil, among other countries. \\n  \\n Mr. Obama found himself in September standing uncomfortably beside the president of Brazil, Dilma Rousseff, who was furious at being named as a target of N.S.A. eavesdropping. Since then, there has been a parade of such protests, from the European Union, Mexico, France, Germany and Spain. Chagrined American officials joke that soon there will be complaints from foreign leaders feeling slighted because the agency had not targeted them. \\n  \\n James R. Clapper Jr., the director of national intelligence, has repeatedly dismissed such objections as brazen hypocrisy from countries that do their own share of spying. But in a recent interview, he acknowledged that the scale of eavesdropping by the N.S.A., with 35,000 workers and $10.8 billion a year, sets it apart. “There’s no question that from a capability standpoint we probably dwarf everybody on the planet, just about, with perhaps the exception of Russia and China,” he said. \\n  \\n Since Edward J. Snowden began releasing the agency’s documents in June, the unrelenting stream of disclosures has opened the most extended debate on the agency’s mission since its creation in 1952. The scrutiny has ignited a crisis of purpose and legitimacy for the N.S.A., the nation’s largest intelligence agency, and the White House has ordered a review of both its domestic and its foreign intelligence collection. While much of the focus has been on whether the agency violates Americans’ privacy, an issue under examination by Congress and two review panels, the anger expressed around the world about American surveillance has prompted far broader questions. \\n  \\n If secrecy can no longer be taken for granted, when does the political risk of eavesdropping overseas outweigh its intelligence benefits? Should foreign citizens, many of whom now rely on American companies for email and Internet services, have any privacy protections from the N.S.A.? Will the American Internet giants’ collaboration with the agency, voluntary or otherwise, damage them in international markets? And are the agency’s clandestine efforts to weaken encryption making the Internet less secure for everyone? \\n  \\n Matthew M. Aid, an intelligence historian and author of a 2009 book on the N.S.A., said there is no precedent for the hostile questions coming at the agency from all directions. \\n  \\n “From N.S.A.’s point of view, it’s a disaster,” Mr. Aid said. “Every new disclosure reinforces the notion that the agency needs to be reined in. There are political consequences, and there will be operational consequences.” \\n  \\n A review of classified agency documents obtained by Mr. Snowden and shared with The New York Times by The Guardian, offers a rich sampling of the agency’s global operations and culture. (At the agency’s request, The Times is withholding some details that officials said could compromise intelligence operations.) The N.S.A. seems to be listening everywhere in the world, gathering every stray electron that might add, however minutely, to the United States government’s knowledge of the world. To some Americans, that may be a comfort.

After mounting a major eavesdropping effort focused on a climate change conference in Bali in 2007, agency analysts stationed in Australia’s outback were especially thrilled by one catch: the cellphone number of Bali’s police chief. \\n  \\n “Our mission,” says the agency’s current five-year plan, which has not been officially scheduled for declassification until 2032, “is to answer questions about threatening activities that others mean to keep hidden.” \\n  \\n Advertisement Continue reading the main story \\n  \\n The aspirations are grandiose: to “utterly master” foreign intelligence carried on communications networks. The language is corporate: “Our business processes need to promote data-driven decision-making.” But the tone is also strikingly moralistic for a government bureaucracy. Perhaps to counter any notion that eavesdropping is a shady enterprise, signals intelligence, or Sigint, the term of art for electronic intercepts, is presented as the noblest of callings. \\n  \\n “Sigint professionals must hold the moral high ground, even as terrorists or dictators seek to exploit our freedoms,” the plan declares. “Some of our adversaries will say or do anything to advance their cause; we will not.” \\n  \\n Advertisement Continue reading the main story \\n  \\n The N.S.A. documents taken by Mr. Snowden and shared with The Times, numbering in the thousands and mostly dating from 2007 to 2012, are part of a collection of about 50,000 items that focus mainly on its British counterpart, Government Communications Headquarters or G.C.H.Q. \\n  \\n Advertisement Continue reading the main story \\n  \\n While far from comprehensive, the documents give a sense of the agency’s reach and abilities, from the Navy ships snapping up radio transmissions as they cruise off the coast of China, to the satellite dishes at Fort Meade in Maryland ingesting worldwide banking transactions, to the rooftops of 80 American embassies and consulates around the world from which the agency’s Special Collection Service aims its antennas. \\n  \\n Photo \\n  \\n The agency and its many defenders among senior government officials who have relied on its top secret reports say it is crucial to American security and status in the world, pointing to terrorist plots disrupted, nuclear proliferation tracked and diplomats kept informed. \\n  \\n Advertisement Continue reading the main story \\n  \\n But the documents released by Mr. Snowden sometimes also seem to underscore the limits of what even the most intensive intelligence collection can achieve by itself. Blanket N.S.A. eavesdropping in Afghanistan, described in the documents as covering government offices and the hide-outs of second-tier Taliban militants alike, has failed to produce a clear victory against a low-tech enemy. The agency kept track as Syria amassed its arsenal of chemical weapons — but that knowledge did nothing to prevent the gruesome slaughter outside Damascus in August. \\n  \\n Advertisement Continue reading the main story \\n  \\n The documents are skewed toward celebration of the agency’s self-described successes, as underlings brag in PowerPoints to their bosses about their triumphs and the managers lay out grand plans. But they do not entirely omit the agency’s flubs and foibles: flood tides of intelligence gathered at huge cost that goes unexamined; intercepts that cannot be read for lack of language skills; and computers that — even at the N.S.A. — go haywire in all the usual ways. \\n  \\n Mapping Message Trails \\n  \\n In May 2009, analysts at the agency learned that Iran’s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, was to make a rare trip to Kurdistan Province in the country’s mountainous northwest. The agency immediately organized a high-tech espionage mission, part of a continuing project focused on Ayatollah Khamenei called Operation Dreadnought. \\n  \\n Advertisement Continue reading the main story \\n  \\n Working closely with the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency, which handles satellite photography, as well as G.C.H.Q., the N.S.A. team studied the Iranian leader’s entourage, its vehicles and its weaponry from satellites, and intercepted air traffic messages as planes and helicopters took off and landed. \\n  \\n They heard Ayatollah Khamenei’s aides fretting about finding a crane to load an ambulance and fire truck onto trucks for the journey. They listened as he addressed a crowd, segregated by gender, in a soccer field. \\n  \\n They studied Iranian air defense radar stations and recorded the travelers’ rich communications trail, including Iranian satellite coordinates collected by an N.S.A. program called Ghosthunter. The point was not so much to catch the Iranian leader’s words, but to gather the data for blanket eavesdropping on Iran in the event of a crisis. \\n  \\n Advertisement Continue reading the main story \\n  \\n This “communications fingerprinting,” as a document called it, is the key to what the N.S.A. does. It allows the agency’s computers to scan the stream of international communications and pluck out messages tied to the supreme leader. In a crisis — say, a showdown over Iran’s nuclear program — the ability to tap into the communications of leaders, generals and scientists might give a crucial advantage. \\n  \\n Advertisement Continue reading the main story \\n  \\n On a more modest scale, the same kind of effort, what N.S.A. calls “Sigint development,” was captured in a document the agency obtained in 2009 from Somalia — whether from a human source or an electronic break-in was not noted. It contained email addresses and other contact details for 117 selected customers of a Mogadishu Internet service, Globalsom. \\n  \\n While most on the list were Somali officials or citizens, presumably including some suspected of militancy, the document also included emails for a United Nations political officer in Mogadishu and a local representative for the charity World Vision, among other international institutions. All, it appeared, were considered fair game for monitoring. \\n  \\n Advertisement Continue reading the main story \\n  \\n This huge investment in collection is driven by pressure from the agency’s “customers,” in government jargon, not only at the White House, Pentagon, F.B.I. and C.I.A., but also spread across the Departments of State and Energy, Homeland Security and Commerce, and the United States Trade Representative. \\n  \\n Photo \\n  \\n By many accounts, the agency provides more than half of the intelligence nuggets delivered to the White House early each morning in the President’s Daily Brief — a measure of success for American spies. (One document boasts that listening in on Nigerian State Security had provided items for the briefing “nearly two dozen” times.) In every international crisis, American policy makers look to the N.S.A. for inside information. \\n  \\n Advertisement Continue reading the main story \\n  \\n Pressure to Get Everything \\n  \\n That creates intense pressure not to miss anything. When that is combined with an ample budget and near-invisibility to the public, the result is aggressive surveillance of the kind that has sometimes gotten the agency in trouble with the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court, a United States federal court that polices its programs for breaches of Americans’ privacy. \\n  \\n In the funding boom that followed the Sept. 11 attacks, the agency expanded and decentralized far beyond its Fort Meade headquarters in Maryland, building or expanding major facilities in Georgia, Texas, Colorado, Hawaii, Alaska, Washington State and Utah. Its officers also operate out of major overseas stations in England, Australia, South Korea and Japan, at overseas military bases, and from locked rooms housing the Special Collection Service inside American missions abroad. \\n  \\n The agency, using a combination of jawboning, stealth and legal force, has turned the nation’s Internet and telecommunications companies into collection partners, installing filters in their facilities, serving them with court orders, building back doors into their software and acquiring keys to break their encryption. \\n  \\n Advertisement Continue reading the main story \\n  \\n But even that vast American-run web is only part of the story. For decades, the N.S.A. has shared eavesdropping duties with the rest of the so-called Five Eyes, the Sigint agencies of Britain, Canada, Australia and New Zealand. More limited cooperation occurs with many more countries, including formal arrangements called Nine Eyes and 14 Eyes and Nacsi, an alliance of the agencies of 26 NATO countries. \\n  \\n Advertisement Continue reading the main story \\n  \\n The extent of Sigint sharing can be surprising: “N.S.A. may pursue a relationship with Vietnam,” one 2009 G.C.H.Q. document reported. But a recent G.C.H.Q. training document suggests that not everything is shared, even between the United States and Britain. “Economic well-being reporting,” it says, referring to intelligence gathered to aid the British economy, “cannot be shared with any foreign partner.” \\n  \\n As at the school lunch table, decisions on who gets left out can cause hurt feelings: “Germans were a little grumpy at not being invited to join the 9-Eyes group,” one 2009 document remarks. And in a delicate spy-versus-spy dance, sharing takes place even with governments that are themselves important N.S.A. targets, notably Israel. \\n  \\n Advertisement Continue reading the main story \\n  \\n The documents describe collaboration with the Israel Sigint National Unit, which gets raw N.S.A. eavesdropping material and provides it in return, but they also mention the agency’s tracking of “high priority Israeli military targets,” including drone aircraft and the Black Sparrow missile system. \\n  \\n Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you\\'re not a robot by clicking the box.

At one highly valued overseas listening post, the very presence of American N.S.A. personnel violates a treaty agreed to by the agency’s foreign host. Even though much of the eavesdropping is run remotely from N.S.A.’s base at Fort Gordon, Ga., Americans who visit the site must pose as contractors, carry fake business cards and are warned: “Don’t dress as typical Americans.\" \\n  \\n “Know your cover legend,” a PowerPoint security briefing admonishes the N.S.A. staff members headed to the overseas station, directing them to “sanitize personal effects,” send no postcards home and buy no identifiably local souvenirs. (“An option might be jewelry. Most jewelry does not have any markings” showing its place of origin.) \\n  \\n Advertisement Continue reading the main story \\n  \\n Bypassing Security \\n  \\n In the agency’s early years, its brainy staff members — it remains the largest employer of mathematicians in the country — played an important role in the development of the first computers, then largely a tool for code breaking. \\n  \\n Photo \\n  \\n Today, with personal computers, laptops, tablets and smartphones in most homes and government offices in the developed world, hacking has become the agency’s growth area. \\n  \\n Advertisement Continue reading the main story \\n  \\n Some of Mr. Snowden’s documents describe the exploits of Tailored Access Operations, the prim name for the N.S.A. division that breaks into computers around the world to steal the data inside, and sometimes to leave spy software behind. T.A.O. is increasingly important in part because it allows the agency to bypass encryption by capturing messages as they are written or read, when they are not encoded. \\n  \\n Advertisement Continue reading the main story \\n  \\n In Baghdad, T.A.O. collected messages left in draft form in email accounts maintained by leaders of the Islamic State of Iraq, a militant group. Under a program called Spinaltap, the division’s hackers identified 24 unique Internet Protocol addresses identifying computers used by the Lebanese militant group Hezbollah, making it possible to snatch Hezbollah messages from the flood of global communications sifted by the agency. \\n  \\n The N.S.A.’s elite Transgression Branch, created in 2009 to “discover, understand, evaluate and exploit” foreign hackers’ work, quietly piggybacks on others’ incursions into computers of interest, like thieves who follow other housebreakers around and go through the windows they have left ajar. \\n  \\n In one 2010 hacking operation code-named Ironavenger, for instance, the N.S.A. spied simultaneously on an ally and an adversary. Analysts spotted suspicious emails being sent to a government office of great intelligence interest in a hostile country and realized that an American ally was “spear-phishing” — sending official-looking emails that, when opened, planted malware that let hackers inside. \\n  \\n Advertisement Continue reading the main story \\n  \\n The Americans silently followed the foreign hackers, collecting documents and passwords from computers in the hostile country, an elusive target. They got a look inside that government and simultaneously got a close-up look at the ally’s cyberskills, the kind of intelligence twofer that is the unit’s specialty. \\n  \\n In many other ways, advances in computer and communications technology have been a boon for the agency. N.S.A. analysts tracked the electronic trail left by a top leader of Al Qaeda in Africa each time he stopped to use a computer on his travels. They correctly predicted his next stop, and the police were there to arrest him. \\n  \\n Advertisement Continue reading the main story \\n  \\n And at the big N.S.A. station at Fort Gordon, technicians developed an automated service called “Where’s My Node?” that sent an email to an analyst every time a target overseas moved from one cell tower to another. Without lifting a finger, an analyst could follow his quarry’s every move. \\n  \\n Advertisement Continue reading the main story \\n  \\n The Limits of Spying \\n  \\n The techniques described in the Snowden documents can make the N.S.A. seem omniscient, and nowhere in the world is that impression stronger than in Afghanistan. But the agency’s capabilities at the tactical level have not been nearly enough to produce clear-cut strategic success there, in the United States’ longest war. \\n  \\n A single daily report from June 2011 from the N.S.A.’s station in Kandahar, Afghanistan, the heart of Taliban country, illustrates the intensity of eavesdropping coverage, requiring 15 pages to describe a day’s work. \\n  \\n Advertisement Continue reading the main story \\n  \\n The agency listened while insurgents from the Haqqani network mounted an attack on the Hotel Intercontinental in Kabul, overhearing the attackers talking to their bosses in Pakistan’s tribal area and recording events minute by minute. “Ruhullah claimed he was on the third floor and had already inflicted one casualty,” the report said in a typical entry. “He also indicated that Hafiz was located on a different floor.” \\n  \\n Photo \\n  \\n N.S.A. officers listened as two Afghan Foreign Ministry officials prepared for a meeting between President Hamid Karzai of Afghanistan and Iranian officials, assuring them that relations with the United States “would in no way threaten the interests of Iran,” which they decided Mr. Karzai should describe as a “brotherly country.” \\n  \\n The N.S.A. eavesdropped as the top United Nations official in Afghanistan, Staffan de Mistura, consulted his European Union counterpart, Vygaudas Usackas, about how to respond to an Afghan court’s decision to overturn the election of 62 members of Parliament. \\n  \\n Advertisement Continue reading the main story \\n  \\n And the agency was a fly on the wall for a long-running land dispute between the mayor of Kandahar and a prominent local man known as the Keeper of the Cloak of the Prophet Muhammad, with President Karzai’s late brother, Ahmed Wali Karzai, as a mediator. \\n  \\n The agency discovered a Taliban claim to have killed five police officers at a checkpoint by giving them poisoned yogurt, and heard a provincial governor tell an aide that a district police chief was verbally abusing women and clergymen. \\n  \\n Advertisement Continue reading the main story \\n  \\n A Taliban figure, Mullah Rahimullah Akhund, known on the United States military’s kill-or-capture list by the code name Objective Squiz Incinerator, was overheard instructing an associate to buy suicide vests and a Japanese motorbike, according to the documents. \\n  \\n And N.S.A. listened in as a Saudi extremist, Abu Mughira, called his mother to report that he and his fellow fighters had entered Afghanistan and “done victorious operations.” \\n  \\n Such reports flowed from the agency’s Kandahar station day after day, year after year, and surely strengthened the American campaign against the Taliban. But they also suggest the limits of intelligence against a complex political and military challenge. The N.S.A. recorded the hotel attack, but it had not prevented it. It tracked Mr. Karzai’s government, but he remained a difficult and volatile partner. Its surveillance was crucial in the capture or killing of many enemy fighters, but not nearly enough to remove the Taliban’s ominous shadow from Afghanistan’s future. \\n  \\n Advertisement Continue reading the main story \\n  \\n Mining All the Tidbits \\n  \\n In the Afghan reports and many others, a striking paradox is the odd intimacy of a sprawling, technology-driven agency with its targets. It is the one-way intimacy of the eavesdropper, as N.S.A. employees virtually enter the office cubicles of obscure government officials and the Spartan hide-outs of drug traffickers and militants around the world. \\n  \\n Advertisement Continue reading the main story \\n  \\n Venezuela, for instance, was one of six “enduring targets” in N.S.A.’s official mission list from 2007, along with China, North Korea, Iraq, Iran and Russia. The United States viewed itself in a contest for influence in Latin America with Venezuela’s leader then, the leftist firebrand Hugo Chávez, who allied himself with Cuba, and one agency goal was “preventing Venezuela from achieving its regional leadership objectives and pursuing policies that negatively impact U.S. global interests.” \\n  \\n A glimpse of what this meant in practice comes in a brief PowerPoint presentation from August 2010 on “Development of the Venezuelan Economic Mission.” The N.S.A. was tracking billions of dollars flowing to Caracas in loans from China (radar systems and oil drilling), Russia (MIG fighter planes and shoulder-fired missiles) and Iran (a factory to manufacture drone aircraft). \\n  \\n Advertisement Continue reading the main story \\n  \\n But it was also getting up-close and personal with Venezuela’s Ministry of Planning and Finance, monitoring the government and personal emails of the top 10 Venezuelan economic officials. An N.S.A. officer in Texas, in other words, was paid each day to peruse the private messages of obscure Venezuelan bureaucrats, hunting for tidbits that might offer some tiny policy edge. \\n  \\n Photo \\n  \\n In a counterdrug operation in late 2011, the agency’s officers seemed to know more about relations within a sprawling narcotics network than the drug dealers themselves. They listened to “Ricketts,” a Jamaican drug supplier based in Ecuador, struggling to keep his cocaine and marijuana smuggling business going after an associate, “Gordo,” claimed he had paid $250,000 and received nothing in return. \\n  \\n Advertisement Continue reading the main story \\n  \\n The N.S.A., a report said, was on top of not just their cellphones, but also those of the whole network of “buyers, transporters, suppliers, and middlemen” stretching from the Netherlands and Nova Scotia to Panama City and Bogotá, Colombia. The documents do not say whether arrests resulted from all that eavesdropping. \\n  \\n Even with terrorists, N.S.A. units can form a strangely personal relationship. The N.S.A.-G.C.H.Q. wiki, a top secret group blog that Mr. Snowden downloaded, lists 14 specialists scattered in various stations assigned to Lashkar-e-Taiba, the Pakistani terrorist group that carried out the bloody attack on Mumbai in 2008, with titles including “Pakistan Access Pursuit Team” and “Techniques Discovery Branch.” Under the code name Treaclebeta, N.S.A.’s hackers at Tailored Access Operations also played a role. \\n  \\n Advertisement Continue reading the main story \\n  \\n In the wiki’s casual atmosphere, American and British eavesdroppers exchange the peculiar shoptalk of the secret world. “I don’t normally use Heretic to scan the fax traffic, I use Nucleon,” one user writes, describing technical tools for searching intercepted documents. \\n  \\n Advertisement Continue reading the main story \\n  \\n But most striking are the one-on-one pairings of spies and militants; Bryan is assigned to listen in on a man named Haroon, and Paul keeps an ear on Fazl. \\n  \\n A Flood of Details \\n  \\n One N.S.A. officer on the Lashkar-e-Taiba beat let slip that some of his eavesdropping turned out to be largely pointless, perhaps because of the agency’s chronic shortage of skilled linguists. He “ran some queries” to read intercepted communications of certain Lashkar-e-Taiba members, he wrote in the wiki, but added: “Most of it is in Arabic or Farsi, so I can’t make much of it.” \\n  \\n It is a glimpse of the unsurprising fact that sometimes the agency’s expensive and expansive efforts accomplish little. Despite the agency’s embrace of corporate jargon on goal-setting and evaluation, it operates without public oversight in an arena in which achievements are hard to measure. \\n  \\n Advertisement Continue reading the main story \\n  \\n In a world of ballooning communications, the agency is sometimes simply overwhelmed. In 2008, the N.S.A.’s Middle East and North Africa group set about updating its Sigint collection capabilities. The “ambitious scrub” of selectors — essentially search terms — cut the number of terms automatically searched from 21,177 to 7,795 and the number of messages added to the agency’s Pinwale database from 850,000 a day to 450,000 a day. \\n  \\n The reduction in volume was treated as a major achievement, opening the way for new collection on Iranian leadership and Saudi and Syrian diplomats, the report said. \\n  \\n Advertisement Continue reading the main story \\n  \\n And in a note that may comfort computer novices, the N.S.A. Middle East analysts discovered major glitches in their search software: The computer was searching for the names of targets but not their email addresses, a rather fundamental flaw. “Over 500 messages in one week did not come in,” the report said about one target. \\n  \\n Those are daily course corrections. Whether the Snowden disclosures will result in deeper change is uncertain. Joel F. Brenner, the agency’s former inspector general, says much of the criticism is unfair, reflecting a naïveté about the realpolitik of spying. “The agency is being browbeaten for doing too well the things it’s supposed to do,” he said. \\n  \\n But Mr. Brenner added that he believes “technology has outrun policy” at the N.S.A., and that in an era in which spying may well be exposed, “routine targeting of close allies is bad politics and is foolish.” \\n  \\n Another former insider worries less about foreign leaders’ sensitivities than the potential danger the sprawling agency poses at home. William E. Binney, a former senior N.S.A. official who has become an outspoken critic, says he has no problem with spying on foreign targets like Brazil’s president or the German chancellor, Angela Merkel. “That’s pretty much what every government does,” he said. “It’s the foundation of diplomacy.” But Mr. Binney said that without new leadership, new laws and top-to-bottom reform, the agency will represent a threat of “turnkey totalitarianism” — the capability to turn its awesome power, now directed mainly against other countries, on the American public. \\n  \\n Advertisement Continue reading the main story \\n  \\n “I think it’s already starting to happen,” he said. “That’s what we have to stop.” \\n  \\n Whatever reforms may come, Bobby R. Inman, who weathered his own turbulent period as N.S.A. director from 1977 to 1981, offers his hyper-secret former agency a radical suggestion for right now. “My advice would be to take everything you think Snowden has and get it out yourself,” he said. “It would certainly be a shock to the agency. But bad news doesn’t get better with age. The sooner they get it out and put it behind them, the faster they can begin to rebuild.” |||||',\n"," \"× \\n  \\n remaining of \\n  \\n Thank you for Reading!

Donald Blakeslee says he’s found it. \\n  \\n The discovery could put south-central Kansas on the map as the second-biggest settlement of Native Americans found in the United States, Blakeslee said. And it’s now, finally, the known location of a 1601 battle pitting outnumbered Spaniards firing cannon into waves of attacking Indian warriors. \\n  \\n Be the first to know. No one covers what is happening in our community better than we do. And with a digital subscription, you'll never miss a local story. SIGN ME UP! \\n  \\n Etzanoa has remained a mystery for 400 years. Archaeologists could not find it. Historians thought reports of a permanent settlement with 20,000 Native Americans in it were exaggerated. \\n  \\n But here in Arkansas City, at the confluence of the Walnut and Arkansas Rivers, Blakeslee, an anthropologist and archaeologist at Wichita State University, has found evidence of a massive town stretching across thousands of acres of bluffs and rich bottomland along two rivers. What clinched it was the discovery, by a high school kid, of a half-inch iron cannon ball. \\n  \\n He even found a still-functional water shrine, depicting communication with the spirit world, carved into a limestone boulder in Tami and Greg Norwood’s backyard. \\n  \\n It’s a good story, all true, Blakeslee said: A lost city, a forgotten mythology — and the story of the once-great Wichita Nation, decimated by European diseases, then pushed aside by American settlers and the United States Army. \\n  \\n Amazed by the size \\n  \\n With the discovery, Arkansas City leaders are hoping to turn their town into a tourist destination. \\n  \\n “We always knew we once had a whole bunch of Indians living around here, because we had found way too many artifacts to think otherwise,” said Jay Warren, an Arkansas City council member. “But we had no idea until Dr. Blakeslee came along about how big it was.” \\n  \\n Etzanoa might have been comparable in size to Cahokia, Blakeslee said. That alone should bring world attention. \\n  \\n The Cahokia Mounds State Historic Site in western Illinois, with its pyramid Monk’s Mound, is the biggest Native American urban complex ever built in the United States. It showcases the 14.4-acre mound that was the centerpiece of the ancient city, along with the outlines of the city, enclosed by fortress walls and filled with shrines of a powerful mythology and culture outside St. Louis. \\n  \\n Cahokia — the remnants of the largest pre-Columbian settlement north of Mexico — attracts 400,000 visitors a year, a fact that gets the attention of Arkansas Citians. If Etzanoa was bigger, “and it might have been,” that will rewrite American history, Blakeslee said. \\n  \\n “The Spaniards were amazed by the size of Etzanoa,” Blakeslee said. “They counted 2,000 houses that could hold 10 people each. They said it would take two or three days to walk through it all.” \\n  \\n But for four centuries, the story of a big Native American town in Kansas made no sense to historians. \\n  \\n When French explorers came in the 1700s, 100 years after the Spanish battle, they met only migratory bands of Kanza, Wichita, Pawnee, Kiowa, Cheyenne and Apache tribes. \\n  \\n So historians read the Spanish accounts and raised questions: If there were a permanent mega-site named Etzanoa, where was the huge accumulation of pottery shards? \\n  \\n And where did those tens of thousands of people go? Twenty thousand, as the Spaniards estimated in 1601, is equivalent to modern-day Derby, Liberal or Hays. \\n  \\n And how could Plains hunters feed tens of thousands day after day? Bison are dangerous. The Wichita had no horses and hunted on foot. \\n  \\n And where were the Spanish cannonballs, fired by outnumbered and terrified Spaniards? \\n  \\n The battle \\n  \\n For years, Blakeslee, 73, had read the accounts of soldiers who served under the Conquistador Juan de Onate, the founding governor of the colony of New Mexico. Onate’s soldiers said they fought a battle 60 years after Coronado, somewhere in the Great Plains. \\n  \\n The battle reports said Onate led 70 soldiers from New Mexico and found a vast town at the junction of two rivers. \\n  \\n Warriors on the outskirts threw dirt into the air as the Spanish approached, signaling they were ready to fight. “The Rayados,” Onate called the Wichitas — “The striped ones,” from the way they painted and tattooed their faces. \\n  \\n The Spaniards entered the town, and the Wichita fled, thousands evacuating to the north. \\n  \\n Onate sent armed patrols into the empty town. \\n  \\n What his soldiers saw unnerved them. They told Onate they’d counted 2,000 big beehive-shaped homes — clusters of these homes surrounded by cornfields. Nervous about the size of the place, they turned around. Indians told them later that the settlement extended for miles past where the Spaniards stopped, meaning the true population might have been higher than the 20,000 Spanish estimate. \\n  \\n Onate turned his men south — and came face to face with hundreds of warriors, firing arrows and charging at Onate’s small Spanish troop. \\n  \\n The attackers were Escanxaques, a tribe enemy to the Wichita. They had come to attack Etzanoa — and now attacked the Spanish. \\n  \\n Sixty of the 70 Spaniards were wounded. Their four cannons saved them, clusters of iron bullets fired from cannon-like shotgun blasts, whistling into trees and boulders. The Escanxaques, stunned, regrouped in a rock-lined ravine, but then charged repeatedly uphill to attack before finally backing off. \\n  \\n Cannonballs confirm \\n  \\n It was a high school kid, Adam Ziegler, who made the link that cinched the verification of Etzanoa. \\n  \\n Blakeslee says artifacts he and Ziegler found in the past two years show the old stories were true, and that between the years 1450 and 1700, at least 20,000 ancestors of today’s Wichita Nation thrived in and near what is now Arkansas City. \\n  \\n Blakeslee realized the confluence of the Walnut and Arkansas rivers could be the one described by the Spanish. He found traces of houses and granaries. He’s walked over much of Arkansas City and saw that the ravines and bluffs fit the Spanish accounts. \\n  \\n After locals like Hap McCleod told him people had been digging up “literally tons” of flint tools and clay pottery shards for generations, Blakeslee dug up his own shards, flint arrowheads, knife blades, hide-scrapers and awls. \\n  \\n Two years ago he found a rock-lined ravine in McLeod’s backyard that matched the Spanish account of where the Escanxaques regrouped under fire to attack. He took a metal detector there, along with Ziegler, a Lawrence Free-State High School freshman. \\n  \\n “They couldn’t find anything that day,” Ziegler recalled. “Dr. Blakeslee said I could use his metal detector. An hour or two later, I found the little ball, buried four inches deep.” \\n  \\n Blakeslee found two more Spanish cannonballs. \\n  \\n That did it, Blakeslee said. The old story was true. \\n  \\n Tough beyond belief \\n  \\n Blakeslee says the Wichita were wronged by fate, disease epidemics and war. He’s going to try to set right what he can. \\n  \\n Smallpox and other illnesses killed probably tens of thousands after 1600, he said. \\n  \\n War and relocation forced survivors to Oklahoma reservations. The tribe lost most of its culture. The tribe’s last fluent speaker of the Wichita language, Doris McLemore, died last year. \\n  \\n The Wichita were organized, cultured — “and tough almost beyond belief,” he said. \\n  \\n They and their Wichita cousins in Quivira, in Rice County, built a trade network with ancestors of the Pueblo Indians in New Mexico. They strapped 50-pound packages of dried meat and hides to themselves and their pack dogs, and walked 550 miles to the Pueblos. They’d then walk back, bringing home cotton fabric, obsidian and turquoise. \\n  \\n They had no horses. The women and children likely helped hunt bison, Blakeslee said, forming lines and waving hide blankets while driving bison toward warriors carrying bows and arrows. “Think of the courage that took,” Blakeslee said. \\n  \\n They cultivated beans, maize (corn), pumpkin and squash. They slaughtered bison meat and hides on an industrial scale. The men likely scouted, walking miles a day, shadowing herds. The women used flint hide-scrapers to thin down bison hides. “From doing that all day, they probably had the toughest fists,” Blakeslee said. “You’d never want to get in a fistfight with a Wichita woman.” \\n  \\n Intrigue, concern \\n  \\n Modern-day Wichitas number about 3,000, based now in Anadarko, Okla., said Gary McAdams, who has held several leadership positions with the Wichita and Affiliated Tribes. \\n  \\n The Wichita are intrigued — and concerned — by what might come next, McAdams said. Blakeslee has consulted with them for years, telling what he’s found, inviting them to visit sites at Arkansas City and at the 160-foot-long serpent symbol still visible in the pasture grass in Rice County. Wichitas have helped on some of his digs. \\n  \\n “We would have some concern about how they go about developing their thinking about Etzanoa as a tourist center,” McAdams said. “We are supportive of any respectful endeavor they want to pursue there — but would want to provide our input.” \\n  \\n Jay Warren, a city council member, says the town will explore development. \\n  \\n Cahokia, in Illinois, attracts 400,000 visitors a year, but mostly because of how striking the 100-foot-tall Monk’s Mound looks, and because it’s located next to St. Louis and Interstate 70. \\n  \\n Arkansas City, in contrast, has pastureland. \\n  \\n But Civil War battlefields don’t have a Monk’s Mound either, Warren said. “And yet they attract thousands of visitors by doing a great job with walking trails and signs that explain step-by-step what was going on.” \\n  \\n If Arkansas City with its 12,000 people could attract 20,000 students, archaeologists and tourists a year, it would give the city a boost, said McLeod, in whose backyard Adam Ziegler found that cannonball. McLeod now runs the Etzanoa Conservancy, and has worked for two years to polish ideas. “We’re really proud that all this history happened here, and we want to share it with the world,” he said. \\n  \\n “We’re not talking about putting together a one-day wonder,” Warren said. “We’re looking at creating something that could be great for the region, and for 50 years and more down the road. We’re talking with (Unified School District) 470 about how it could enhance education. And we think the site could also be a hands-on field training facility for archaeologists from all over the world.” \\n  \\n They could build an interactive visitor center, he said. They could build reconstructions of the grass houses and granaries the Wichita used. They could employ flint-knappers who could show how skilled craftsmen made arrowheads and knife blades. \\n  \\n Etzanoa would have been beautiful, McLeod said. The river bluffs south of Arkansas City look like picture postcards. The bluffs and hills pour out clear spring water from dells and nooks. \\n  \\n McLeod drove up recently to the tallest point in Arkansas City — where the city’s golf course clubhouse sits. \\n  \\n Blakeslee had told him that’s where Caratax, the Wichita chief in 1601, probably kept his home. \\n  \\n “You can see 360 degrees in any direction from here,” McLeod said. \\n  \\n “And it’s all beautiful.” ||||| Volunteer Adam Ziegler found an iron ball while volunteering to help archaeologists uncover remnants of a Native American settlement east of Arkansas City, Kan., in June. The ball was fired by a Spanish cannon at ancestors of the Wichita tribe, who ambushed an expedition led by Don Juan de Onate in 1601, according to Don Blakeslee, an archaeologist who led a study of the site. FOSS FARRAR Arkansas City Traveler ||||| Starting in 1996, Alexa Internet has been donating their crawl data to the Internet Archive. Flowing in every day, these data are added to the Wayback Machine after an embargo period. ||||| Donald Blakeslee, professor of archaeology at Wichita State University, presented in March at the annual conference of the Society for American Archaeology discussing recent archaeological evidence that shows a thriving ancestral Wichita Indian town of more than 20,000 residents near Arkansas City, Kansas. \\n  \\n The discovery began with new translations of old Spanish documents by the Cibola Project at the University of California, Berkley. Members of the team made photocopies of the original documents, re-transcribed them from the Old Spanish and then retranslated them. Earlier historians and archaeologists who had used the documents dealt with misleading errors in transcription and translation, which is why many archaeological discoveries in the area were misinterpreted. \\n  \\n “It has been a lot of fun to rewrite the record so thoroughly. By joining the historical written record to the archaeology, we ended up rewriting both fields,” says Blakeslee. “Rather than a cluster of 30 little villages, there was a single town of 20,000 people.” \\n  \\n Research of the town, called Etzanoa, has completely revised the understanding of protohistoric settlements in the southern plains. Previous scholars often dismissed the Spanish population estimates as exaggerations, but with the evidence of the archaeological finds it can no longer be dismissed. \\n  \\n “One implication is that Old World epidemic diseases had not yet reached this region, but probably did so by around 1650, because there were far fewer Wichitas when the French arrived in 1718,” says Blakeslee. \\n  \\n Blakeslee reported archaeology that coincides with eyewitness accounts from five soldiers of Spanish explorer and founder of New Mexico, Juan de Oñate, who were interviewed in Mexico City in 1602. \\n  \\n Scattered surface finds match the description of the town as extending about five miles, and the description of the landscape and route of the Spanish army also line up. The biggest piece of confirmation came with the discovery of the site of a battle fought there in 1601. Metal detectors were used to uncover small iron shot from in front of the ravine where natives took shelter and well beyond it where shots eventually fell. \\n  \\n Blakeslee began work at the site in 2015 when he invited leaders of the Wichita tribe to visit and spent a week there researching. He’s been able to involve WSU students with the research as well and has taken them to the site each summer since. They plan to be there for four weeks during summer 2017. \\n  \\n “Work at Etzanoa will continue for the rest of my career and beyond,” says Blakeslee. “It will be an important part of WSU’s future.” |||||\",\n"," 'Rep. Anthony Weiner rejected Democratic leaders’ private and public calls for his resignation Saturday, choosing instead to take a leave of absence from the House to seek professional treatment amid an online sex scandal that the head of the party called a “sordid affair.” \\n  \\n Democratic National Committee Chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz, (D-Fla.), House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) and Rep. Steve Israel, the chairman of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, turned on Weiner the day after it was revealed he had contacted a 17-year-old Delaware girl through social media. Though Weiner, Delaware police and the girl’s family say there was nothing indecent in the back-and-forth, the development added intrigue to the New York Democrat’s confession on Monday that he sent sexually charged text messages and photographs to six women over the past three years. \\n  \\n Text Size - \\n  \\n + \\n  \\n reset VIDEO: Weiner’s teary presser POLITICO 44 \\n  \\n For now, his vow to remain in office stands, but he didn’t appear dug in: He left open the possibility, for the first time, of leaving, with a statement that suggested he needs to be in a better mental position to make a decision about his future. \\n  \\n “Congressman Weiner departed this morning to seek professional treatment to focus on becoming a better husband and healthier person,” Weiner’s office said in a statement provided to POLITICO. “In light of that, he will request a short leave of absence from the House of Representatives so that he can get evaluated and map out a course of treatment to make himself well. Congressman Weiner takes the views of his colleagues very seriously and has determined that he needs this time to get healthy and make the best decision possible for himself, his family and his constituents.” \\n  \\n But the mass abandonment from party leaders means Weiner will go it alone if, after reflection and treatment, he believes he can salvage a once-promising career in which he used bombastic floor speeches, frequent cable television appearances and, ironically, an understanding of the power of social media to become an icon for national progressives. The story of Weiner’s political career hasn’t yet reached its conclusion, but the onetime protagonist is now cast as the antagonist. \\n  \\n The decision to seek treatment buys Weiner time, but the statement from his aides suggests he might still quit rather than return to Congress after his leave of absence. \\n  \\n Rep. Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.), the former DCCC chairman and top Democrat on the House Budget Committee, added his name to the list of Democratic officials who have called on Weiner to resign. “Anthony Weiner’s repeated violation of the public trust is unacceptable,” Van Hollen said. “He can best advance the issues he fought for by resigning immediately.” \\n  \\n In addition to Wasserman Schultz, two former DNC chairmen, Ed Rendell and Tim Kaine, have said Weiner should step down, as have several of Weiner’s rank-and-file congressional colleagues. \\n  \\n However, Sen. Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.), the No. 3 Democrat in the Senate, and Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.) both approved of Weiner’s decision to seek treatment and did not call for his resignation. \\n  \\n Schumer, Weiner’s former boss, said: “I am heartbroken. For those of us who are longtime friends of Anthony Weiner, his wrongful behavior is distressing and saddening. It’s clear he needs professional help, and I am glad he is seeking it.” \\n  \\n Gillibrand said: “My heart is with Anthony’s wife and family. My office will work to ensure all the constituents of the 9th congressional District are fully served during any leave of absence by Congressman Weiner.” \\n  \\n On Friday, FOX News reported that Wilmington-area police had visited a Delaware teenager to discuss Weiner’s electronic exchange with her. \\n  \\n Though Weiner and the girl’s family have told news outlets that there was no sex-related communication, the revelation that he carried on a discussion of any kind with a 17-year-old girl pumped more life into a scandal that has now spanned three weekends. ||||| Anthony Weiner takes out his dirty laundry, gets cheers from onlookers amid sext scandal \\n  \\n Joe Marino for News Congressman Anthony Weiner leaves his Forest Hills, Queens, apartment. \\n  \\n Take our Poll Wave Goodbye, Weiner Should Rep.

In her case, filed in the southern district court of Florida, she alleges it took seven months to get chief executive, Rony Abovitz, to attend the presentation, and when he did he left halfway through. Campbell never managed to present the second half. \\n  \\n A year later, another Magic Leap employee, Rachna Bhasin, was asked to head up what the filing describes as “a ‘female brain trust initiative’ – the ‘FBI’”. Bhasin, Campbell and five other women from the company were involved in the initial meeting, in May 2016, alongside Abovitz, the vice-president of product design, Gary Natsume, and “a couple of male members of his team”. \\n  \\n Campbell describes a “chaotic discussion”, in which a number of recommendations were made about a prototype design of Magic Leap’s hardware, “such as not having the headset connect in the back of the head because such a connection is difficult for people with ponytails or long hair”. None of the proposed changes were made to the design, and later meetings, which were not attended by any of the male members of the team, resulted in “no clear path forward”. \\n  \\n As well as presenting an image of a company where Campbell’s efforts to create a female-friendly workplace and product were coolly received, the suit also alleges more direct tolerance of sexist comments and attitudes. The suit alleges: \\n  \\n An image of two doctors, a man and a woman, prompted the comment “look, it’s Bring Your Wife to Work Day”. \\n  \\n One of the three or four core apps that will ship with Magic Leap’s headset “is a game, ‘Dr. G.,’ that has no female heroes or lead characters”. The one female character in the narrative, who isn’t in the game itself, “is a busty woman depicted on her knees grovelling at the heroes’ feet in admiration”. \\n  \\n A group for “magic leap spouses” which was explicitly targeted at “board [sic] wives at home” (the bracketed “[sic]” is in the court filing). \\n  \\n  \\n  \\n A new hire orientation included the unprepared advice: “in IT we have a saying; stay away from the Three Os: Orientals, Old People and Ovaries”. Campbell was told the person in question would not be giving new hire orientations in the future as a result, but that did not happen. \\n  \\n  \\n  \\n Campbell alleges that events like those construe a hostile working environment, and is asking for punitive damages from Magic Leap. The company has not responded to a request for comment. \\n  \\n  \\n  \\n The lawsuit is the latest piece of bad news for Magic Leap, after a string of stories that began with a report in December 2016 that the company was struggling to incorporate the “dazzling” technology it had used to wow investors into the product it was planning to release. \\n  \\n Alternative Dave (@redletterdave) SCOOP!!!

Abovitz responded by arguing that the picture showed “an R&D test rig where we collect room/space data for our machine vision/machine learning work”. ||||| Magic Leap CEO Rony Abovitz Getty A newly filed lawsuit by a former Magic Leap VP alleges that the company is a hostile working place for women, a condition that has led to the company missing internal deadlines, according to the complaint. \\n  \\n Tannen Campbell, whose lawsuit in Southern Florida District Court says she was a VP of marketing and brand identity, says in the complaint that she was hired by Rony Abovitz, the CEO by the Dania Beach, Florida-based company to \"help with the pink/blue\" problem, referring to the lack of women in leadership positions at the company. \\n  \\n She also claims that Magic Leap had a culture that assumed its employees were men, including what she says was an internal email describing a policy for \"bored wives at home while you are loving it at the Leap.\" \\n  \\n \"All the engineers and others in predominately-male Magic Leap could conceive of to make the product female friendly was to produce a version in pink,\" the lawsuit alleges. \\n  \\n According to Campbell\\'s complaint, many of the executives at Magic Leap blocked her efforts to reform company policy before she was fired in late December. \\n  \\n Magic Leap has raised $1.39 billion dollars in venture capital, valuing the company at $4.5 billion, from investors including Andreessen Horowitz, Kleiner Perkins, Google, JPMorgan, Fidelity and Alibaba. The company promises to integrate computer graphics into the real world in a stunning way — a whale jumping out of a gym floor, for example. \\n  \\n But as Business Insider has previously reported, questions remain whether the company can shrink its technology into a mobile, portable form factor. A prototype described to Business Insider by a source as \"the real wearable\" and by CEO Abovitz as \"R&D; test rig where we collect room/space data\" shows a bulky backpack containing the device\\'s computer power, although sources and the lawsuit describe the company\\'s prototype as a \"belt pack.\" \\n  \\n Advertisement \\n  \\n Former employees also describe a company with sprawling operations. The lawsuit alleges that the startup has over 1000 employees. \\n  \\n Magic Leap did not immediately return requests for comment. \\n  \\n Missed deadlines \\n  \\n Campbell, who is suing for Magic Leap for sex discrimination, retaliation and hostile work environment, connects the lack of women in Magic Leap\\'s leadership and engineering department with claims of missed internal deadlines. \\n  \\n From the complaint: \\n  \\n \"The macho bullying atmosphere at Magic Leap fosters a dysfunctional culture which creates chaos and lack of process and structure, hinders the company from achieving key product deadlines (including launch, which has shifted back at least 4 times in Campbell\\'s 1.5 years at the company) and, literally, prevented Campbell from doing the job she was hired to do or achieving the goals she and Abovitz had discussed during her initial interview: helping with the \"pink/blue problem\" or making Magic Leap less of a \"boys club.\"\" \\n  \\n Advertisement \\n  \\n \"Sadly, because Magic Leap seldom hires and does not actively recruit female candidates, the company loses competitive advantage to products like Microsoft\\'s Hololens. Microsoft, which employs far more females on its team, developed its similar product on a faster time line with more content that appeals to both genders.\" \\n  \\n One of the things Campbell connects to her eventual firing was that she challenged Magic Leap CEO Abovitz, comparing herself to the child in the \"Emperor\\'s New Clothes\" who pointed out that the emperor was naked and not in fact wearing extremely cool invisible clothes. \\n  \\n From the complaint: \\n  \\n Campbell also raised concerns that what Magic Leap showed the public in marketing material was not what the product actually could do—admonitions ignored in favor of her male colleagues\\' assertions that the images and videos presented on Magic Leap\\'s website and on YouTube were \"aspirational,\" and not Magic Leap\\'s version of \"alternate facts.\" \\n  \\n Here\\'s the full complaint: \\n  \\n Know anything about Magic Leap? Email the author at kleswing@businessinsider.com. ||||| Magic Leap, the mysterious augmented reality startup, continues its slow implosion. \\n  \\n On Monday, a new lawsuit alleged that the Plantation, Fla.-based company promoted a sexist work environment and used misleading marketing materials that inaccurately depicted the product\\'s capabilities. \\n  \\n Tannen Campbell, Magic Leap\\'s former vice president of strategic marketing and brand identity, filed the suit in a federal court in the Southern District of Florida. \\n  \\n The lawsuit alleged Campbell was fired because the company\\'s CEO, Rony Abovitz, refused to acknowledge the misogyny within the company and address a hostile work environment. The company is accused of violating the Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which prohibits employers from discriminating against employees on the basis of sex, race, color, national origin and religion. Ultimately, these workplace problems, the lawsuit reads, \"renders it so dysfunctional it continues to delay the launch of a product that attracted billions of investment dollars.\" \\n  \\n Founded in 2010, the company is developing an augmented reality headset that superimposes virtual objects onto the real world, and has amassed $1.4 billion from the likes Google and Alibaba, despite no announced product for sale yet. Late last year, an article by the Information reported that investors poured money into the company after seeing impressive demonstrations of early prototypes, but the actual first commercial product will unlikely possess those same capabilities. And last week, a Business Insider article showed a widely-mocked image of what is reportedly a crude prototype of the device. \\n  \\n In the lawsuit, Campbell said she brought up concerns that the company was showing off marketing material that didn\\'t accurately reflect what Magic Leap\\'s technology could actually do. The warnings were \"ignored in favor of her male colleagues’ assertions that the images and videos presented on Magic Leap’s website and on YouTube were \\'aspirational,\\' and not Magic Leap’s version of \\'alternate facts,\\' \" the lawsuit said in an apparent reference to U.S. President Donald J. Trump counselor Kellyanne Conway\\'s infamous use of the term \"alternative facts.\" \\n  \\n Campbell joined Magic Leap in April 2015 when there were no women in leadership positions, the lawsuit said. During Campbell\\'s initial interview at Magic Leap, she joked that the company\\'s advertising department was a \"boys club,\" but Abovitz told her he was looking to change that. \\n  \\n \"All the engineers and others in predominately-male Magic Leap could conceive of to make the product female friendly was to produce a version in pink,\" the lawsuit said. \\n  \\n The company\\'s mostly male leadership team is made up of what the lawsuit described as \"Abovitz sycophants.\" The one female leader, chief business officer Rachna Bhasin, is characterized as \"the perfect Magic Leap female employee: she went [to] Harvard, never disagrees with Abovitz and always does Abovitz\\'s bidding even when common sense or her own experience run counter. She makes the company appear diverse and inclusive although it is not.\" \\n  \\n In the first few months at Magic Leap, Campbell said she tried to change things. She came up with a PowerPoint presentation that outlined that only 14% of overall Magic Leap employees were female and 3% of engineering staff were female. She offered proposals to encourage more female inclusion in the short term, like recruiting from colleges with high numbers of female engineers, and in the long term, like tying bonuses to boosting diversity numbers. The lawsuit said Abovitz kept putting off these meetings, or cutting them short when they happened. \\n  \\n Eventually, Abovitz put together the \"female brain trust initiative\" (or FBI), headed up by Bhasin, to make sure Magic Leap product design and content was developed with women in mind. The first meeting on May 18, 2016 presented a prototype with the power supply implemented in a \"belt pack,\" and recommended not having the headset connect in the back of the head, to make it easier to wear for people with long hair or ponytails. The group make no inroads and none of the proposals made it into the design process. The group was pure \"window dressing,\" the lawsuit alleged. Abovitz and other men didn\\'t show up to later meetings. \\n  \\n The lawsuit said three or four core apps that the standard Magic Leap headset will end up shipping with included a game called \"Dr. G,\" which had no lead female characters. The one female character is \"busty\" and depicted as groveling on her knees at the main character\\'s feet. Campbell complained repeatedly to the designers with no success about the game\\'s misogyny, the complaint said. \\n  \\n Sexist attitudes were abundant at the company, the lawsuit said. In one instance, Campbell attended a conference call in September 2016 with several executives to talk with advertising agency R/GA. During the call, Magic Leap CFO Scott Henry said, \"I’m sitting here between two beautiful ladies. They’re not going to want to put a big ugly device over their pretty faces. And I have an office with glass doors, I don’t want people to see me with these beautiful girls with ugly things on their faces,\" the complaint alleged, referring to Campbell and the company\\'s head of operations, Tina Tuli. After the call, R/GA executives expressed concern about Henry\\'s remarks. \\n  \\n Campbell, who joined as head of advertising, was made vice president only after she asked for the promotion in September 2016. Campbell said in the lawsuit that this is an example of the company\\'s leadership inability to make decisions. \\n  \\n \"Abovitz was incapable of making decisions,\" the lawsuit said, \"but rather kept putting things off pending more meetings and assigning more people to solve the problem, which was one of the primary reasons Magic Leap could not bring its product to market.\" \\n  \\n After the the promotion, the complaint said Campbell was marginalized in the leadership team. In her last four months, it said Abovitz \"who always had been pouty and prone to temper-tantrums, began to dig his heels in even more in the face of dissenting ideas and to explode ever more frequently into child-like fits of rage, threatening retribution when he didn’t get his way, felt betrayed or was portrayed publically [sic] in an unfavorable light.\" \\n  \\n In Campbell\\'s final months at Magic Leap, Abovitz disinvited her from meetings. In November 2016, Abovitz told Campbell to interview employees about their opinions of the company. She told Abovitz Magic Leap should instead work towards branding for a target audience, not just employees. Regardless, Campbell followed orders and presented her findings on December 20, but was instead fired. Magic Leap offered Campbell a three-months severance if she released all claims against the company. She refused to sign. \\n  \\n The lawsuit alleged the company\\'s sexism has lead to dysfunction and is losing out to competitors like Microsoft\\'s HoloLens. \"Microsoft, which employs far more females on its team, developed its similar product on a faster time line with more content that appeals to both genders,\" the complainant said. \\n  \\n Magic Leap hasn\\'t responded to a request for comment. \\n  \\n Follow me on Twitter @aatilley or send me an email: atilley@forbes.com |||||',\n"," 'Research suggests that the ratio of the lengths of the index finger and the ring finger in males may be predictive of a variety of disorders related to disturbed hormonal balance.

Some authors have suggested a relationship between androgen exposure during the prenatal period and schizophrenia. These two separate relationships suggest that digit length ratios are associated with schizophrenia in males. The study was performed in a university hospital between October 2012 and May 2013. One hundred and three male patients diagnosed with schizophrenia according to DSM‐IV using SCID‐I, and 100 matched healthy males, were admitted to the study. Scale for the Assessment of Positive Symptoms (SAPS), Scale for the Assessment of Negative Symptoms (SANS) and Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS) were used to assess schizophrenia symptoms. The second digit (2D) and fourth digit (4D) asymmetry index (AI), and the right‐ and left‐hand 2D:4D ratios were calculated. All parametric data in the groups were compared using an independent t‐test. The predictive power of the AI was estimated by receiver operating characteristics analysis. The 2D:4D AI was statistically significantly lower in the patient group than the healthy control comparison group. There were significant differences between the schizophrenia and the control groups in respect of left 2D:4D and right 2D:4D. There was no correlation between AI, left, or right 2D:4D, BPRS, or SAPS in the schizophrenia group. However, there was a negative correlation between left 2nd digit (L2D):4D and the SANS score. Our findings support the view that the 2D:4D AI can be used as a moderate indicator of schizophrenia. Even more simply, the right or left 2D:4D can be used as an indicator. L2D:4D could indicate the severity of negative symptoms. Clin.

The airline is still facing fallout over an incident with David Dao, a passenger who was violently dragged off a flight in Chicago in April. \\n  \\n The video of the Texas pushing incident was obtained and broadcast Tuesday evening by Houston news station KPRC. \\n  \\n The passenger, Ronald Tigner, a Houston lawyer, is suing United and two of its employees for more than $1 million, alleging negligence in the incident that took place July 21, 2015, at George Bush Intercontinental Airport in Houston. \\n  \\n In response to the video, United released a statement to KPRC saying it is “disturbed by the completely unacceptable behavior shown in a video of a customer and a former United employee.” The employee is no longer with the company, according to the statement. \\n  \\n “The actions shown here do not reflect our core values or our commitment to treat all of our customers with respect and dignity,” United’s statement read. “We are reviewing all circumstances surrounding this incident and reaching out to our customer through his attorney to profusely apologize for what occurred and to make this right.” \\n  \\n The encounter began when Tigner received a boarding pass that was illegible. He made “numerous attempts” to ask for a reprinted pass, but United agents denied him one, according to the lawsuit. \\n  \\n He was told to continue on to the security checkpoint, where Transportation Security Administration authorities refused to let Tigner enter because of his poorly printed pass. \\n  \\n So Tigner went back to the United ticketing area and tried once more to get a new ticket, the lawsuit states. Two United employees, Alejandro Anastasia and Ianthe Phillips-Allred, allegedly refused to help Tigner, laughing and cursing at him, the lawsuit states. \\n  \\n Tigner’s attorney, William Hoke, told KPRC that when Tigner asked Anastasia for a new ticket, he replied with a smile, saying, “Can’t you see I’m busy?” \\n  \\n Tigner then told Anastasia to “wipe that smile off your face,” Hoke said, to which Anastasia responded with an obscenity. \\n  \\n Then, Anastasia “suddenly, unexpectedly and violently injured” Tigner, the lawsuit alleges. \\n  \\n Surveillance video shows the United employee checking his watch, turning toward Tigner and pushing him to the floor. Tigner remains there motionless on his back, his legs and arms spread out. Meanwhile, a couple of people who appear to be airline employees stand near Tigner. \\n  \\n But for about 50 seconds, no one appears to bend down to help Tigner, until a woman — identified by Tigner’s lawyer as a flight passenger and nurse — walks over to check on him. \\n  \\n [United CEO tells Congress dragging man from flight was a ‘horrible failure’ by airline] \\n  \\n A United employee later called 911, telling the operator, “There’s a 70 year old male that had fallen down,” according to a 911 call published by KPRC. When the operator asked the employee what caused the fall and if the man was awake, the caller said he did not know. \\n  \\n Anastasia was later charged with a felony of injuring an elderly individual, KPRC reported. He was fined and ordered to attend anger-management classes and apologize to Tigner. \\n  \\n The lawsuit alleges the confrontation caused Tigner to sustain “severe personal injuries and damages,” and incur medical expenses and lost wages. It says the altercation left him with “physical disfigurement” and caused him to experience “mental anguish.” \\n  \\n It also says that nothing Tigner did or failed to do “caused or contributed to the incident.” \\n  \\n The lawsuit follows a number of high-profile controversies involving United, and the airline industry as a whole. In April, Dao refused to give up his seat on an overbooked United flight and was dragged off bloodied and limp, to the disgust of other passengers who captured it on video. Dao suffered a concussion, broken nose and two missing teeth, among other injuries, The Washington Post reported. \\n  \\n Since then, other airlines have come under fire for kicking a family off a flight due to a dispute over a birthday cake and booting a passenger from a plane for using a restroom. \\n  \\n One of the most recent confrontations also involved Houston-based United Airlines agents, who told Yennifer Correia she would have to check her 17th-century violin. \\n  \\n A “wrestling match” ensued, The Post reported, leaving Correia with an injured hand. \\n  \\n More from Morning Mix: \\n  \\n Trump calls mayor of shrinking Chesapeake island and tells him not to worry about it \\n  \\n Megyn Kelly dropped as host for Sandy Hook group’s gala over Alex Jones interview \\n  \\n Arrest of Miss Black Texas not racially motivated, outside investigation finds ||||| HOUSTON - For decades, United Airlines has boasted \"come fly the friendly skies of United,\" but in April, video of Dr. David Dao being dragged off a United flight in Chicago went viral. \\n  \\n When Dao refused to give up his seat onboard an overbooked flight, security officers began dragging him down the aisle and off the plane in front of horrified passengers. \\n  \\n Now, Channel 2 Investigates has obtained video of another physical confrontation between United employees and a 71-year-old Houston man at Bush Intercontinental Airport in 2015. That man has filed a lawsuit. \\n  \\n VIDEO: Full airport surveillance video of United worker pushing Houston passenger to ground \\n  \\n \"This is just one of the most inhumane things I\\'ve ever seen in my life,\" attorney William Hoke said. \\n  \\n In the video, recorded on a surveillance camera at the airport, Ronald Tigner -- a frequent flyer, father and grandfather -- is shown being pushed to the ground by a United Airlines customer service rep, right in front of the United ticket counter. \\n  \\n After hitting his head on the ground, Tigner lies motionless with his arms splayed out and yet not one United employee bothers to bend down and talk to him. \\n  \\n \"He violently shoves a 71-year-old man to the ground,\" Hoke said. \\n  \\n \"Was your client knocked unconscious? Was he out?\" KPRC 2\\'s Bill Spencer asked. \\n  \\n \"He was. He lied there,\" Hoke said. \"He lies there lifeless for minutes. Not one employee comes to check on him.\" \\n  \\n \"None of the United employees even bend down to see if he\\'s OK, to see it he\\'s alive?\" Spencer asked. \\n  \\n VIDEO: United apologizes to passenger \\n  \\n \"No one even went to check his pulse,\" Hoke said. \"They literally left him there like a piece of garbage.\" \\n  \\n In fact, over the course of the nearly three-minute surveillance video, not one United employee ever appears to try to comfort the man in any way. \\n  \\n Fifty seconds into the video, a passenger walking by stops to help, as United employees just watch. \\n  \\n \"It was a good Samaritan, who was a nurse, that was catching a flight, ran over and said, \\'Please, God. Someone call 911,\\'\" Hoke said. \\n  \\n When a United worker does call 911, he doesn\\'t say the man was pushed down, or that\\'s he\\'s unconscious. \\n  \\n 911: \"What is the emergency?\" \\n  \\n Worker: \"There\\'s a 70-year-old male that had fallen down.\" \\n  \\n 911: \"OK, is he awake?\" \\n  \\n Worker: \"I don\\'t know.\" \\n  \\n 911: \"You know what the cause of the fall?\" \\n  \\n Worker: \"No.\" \\n  \\n LISTEN: 911 Call after United employee pushes customer \\n  \\n \"It\\'s astonishing,\" Hoke said. \"It\\'s outrageous.\" \\n  \\n Now Tigner is suing United Airlines, Alejandro Anastasia -- the man who pushed him -- and another United employee for negligence. \\n  \\n Hoke claims this all began with Tigner simply asking Anastasia for a new boarding pass because the one he had was garbled. The suit claims Anastasia laughed at him and cursed at him. \\n  \\n \"Anastasia was looking at Mr. Tigner and started smiling and said, \\'Can\\'t you see we\\'re busy?\\' and there\\'s no one in the vicinity of these two employees,\" Hoke said. \"And he tells Anastasia to wipe that smile off his face. That\\'s when Anastasia says, \\'I\\'ll kick your (expletives)\\' and shoves Tigner to the ground.\" \\n  \\n Anastasia was later charged with the felony crime of injury to an elderly individual, ordered to pay a fine, write a letter of apology and attend anger-management classes. \\n  \\n He was fired after the incident, according to United. \\n  \\n Alejandro Nestor Anstasia \\n  \\n Channel 2 Investigates went to Anastasia\\'s home, but no one answered the door. \\n  \\n \"Mr. Anastasia, what would possess you to throw a 71-year-old man to the floor?\" Spencer had asked. \\n  \\n Tigner is suing United Airlines for more than $1 million. \\n  \\n \"We want people to come forward who\\'ve been treated just like Mr. Tigner and like Dr. Dao, any of the other people who\\'ve flown United and been treated this way, because this has to stop,\" Hoke said. \\n  \\n United Airlines called Tigner\\'s lawyer to offer an apology on Wednesday. \\n  \\n \"(They said) they\\'re truly sorry this happened to Mr. Tigner and they wanted me to convey that to him,\" Hoke said. \\n  \\n United released the following statement: \\n  \\n \"We have seen the video from 2015 that shows completely unacceptable behavior by a United employee.

Mechanically separated poultry is regulated and inspected by USDA and products containing it must declare it as an ingredient on the label. Mechanical systems prevent waste of nutritious meat and avoid the repetitive motion that would be required to perform close trimming by hand.\" ||||| NEW YORK (Reuters Health) - Stand-up comedians have long joked that some things, like the actual components of chicken nuggets, are better left mysterious. \\n  \\n Recently, Mississippi researchers found out why: two nuggets they examined consisted of 50 percent or less chicken muscle tissue, the breast or thigh meat that comes to mind when a customer thinks of \"chicken.\" \\n  \\n The nuggets came from two national fast food chains in Jackson. The three researchers selected one nugget from each box, preserved, dissected and stained the nuggets, then looked at them under a microscope. \\n  \\n The first nugget was about half muscle, with the rest a mix of fat, blood vessels and nerves. Close inspection revealed cells that line the skin and internal organs of the bird, the authors write in the American Journal of Medicine. \\n  \\n The second nugget was only 40 percent muscle, and the remainder was fat, cartilage and pieces of bone. \\n  \\n \"We all know white chicken meat to be one of the best sources of lean protein available and encourage our patients to eat it,\" lead author Dr. Richard D. deShazo of the University of Mississippi Medical Center in Jackson, said. \\n  \\n \"What has happened is that some companies have chosen to use an artificial mixture of chicken parts rather than low-fat chicken white meat, batter it up and fry it and still call it chicken,\" deShazo told Reuters Health. \\n  \\n \"It is really a chicken by-product high in calories, salt, sugar and fat that is a very unhealthy choice. Even worse, it tastes great and kids love it and it is marketed to them.\" \\n  \\n The nuggets he examined would be okay to eat occasionally, but he worries that since they are cheap, convenient and taste good, kids eat them often. His own grandchildren \"beg\" for chicken nuggets all the time, and he compromises by making them at home by pan-frying chicken breasts with a small amount of oil, deShazo said. \\n  \\n \"Chicken nuggets are an excellent source of protein, especially for kids who might be picky eaters,\" said Ashley Peterson, vice president of scientific and regulatory affairs for the National Chicken Council (NCC), a non-profit trade group representing the U.S. chicken industry. \\n  \\n According to the NCC, its member producers and processors account for about 95 percent of the chicken produced in the U.S. \\n  \\n \"This study evaluates only two chicken nugget samples out of the billions of chicken nuggets that are made every year,\" Peterson said. A sample size of two nuggets is simply too small to generalize to an entire category of food, she told Reuters Health. \\n  \\n Two nuggets is a small sample size, deShazo acknowledged, and some chains have begun to use primarily white meat in their nuggets - just not the particular restaurants he visited. \\n  \\n \"Chicken nuggets tend to have an elevated fat content because they are breaded and fried. But it\\'s no secret what is in a chicken nugget - most quick service restaurants have nutritional information posted in the store or on their website,\" Peterson said. \\n  \\n \"And every package of chicken nuggets in the grocery store by law contains an ingredient list and a complete nutritional profile, including fat content,\" she said. \\n  \\n The brief chicken nugget exploration was not meant to be an exposé of the chicken industry or fast food generally, but to remind consumers that \"not everything that tastes good is good for you,\" deShazo said. \\n  \\n He and his colleagues chose not to reveal which chain restaurants they visited. \\n  \\n Consumers aren\\'t necessarily being misled, since much of the nutritional information they need is readily available, he said. \\n  \\n \"We just don\\'t take the time to understand basic nutritional facts.\" \\n  \\n SOURCE: bit.ly/16Inpg8 American Journal of Medicine, online September 13, 2013. |||||',\n"," 'An ex-Colorado sheriff known for his no-nonsense style and a concern about teenage drug use is facing charges of offering methamphetamine in exchange for sex and was being held Wednesday at a jail named for him. \\n  \\n Dressed in an orange jail uniform and walking with a cane, a hand-cuffed Patrick Sullivan, 68, watched as a judge raised his bail amount to a half-million dollars and sent him back to the Patrick J.

Since that first story in April 2009, the Big Sis brand has been trotted out for dozens of Napolitano stories, from the scary (\"BIG SIS: Napolitano to Kill Spy-Satellite Program\") to the silly (\"BIG SIS: Napolitano enlists Girl Scouts in effort to combat hurricanes, pandemics, terror attacks\") to—most important—the creepy sexual stuff about the Transportation Security Administration. In January 2010, Drudge linked to a story about the government acquiring body scanners by pressing the Caps-Lock key and breaking out a photo illustration of Napolitano eying a scan of a nude: \"BIG SIS WANTS TO SEE UNDER YOUR CLOTHES.\" \\n  \\n Ten months later, there is a full-blown revolt against the TSA and body scanners (which are sold by a firm with the poetically unfortunate name of Rapiscan). The revolt will crest next Wednesday, with National Opt-Out Day on the busiest travel period of the year. The accidental guerilla heroico of the revolt is John Tyner, who refused a full-body scan at San Diego International Airport then refused to let TSA agents manually search him. \"You touch my junk,\" he said, \"and I\\'m going to have you arrested.\" \\n  \\n What does this have to do with Matt Drudge? The Tyner Mutiny went viral because the Drudge Report gave it the blaring-siren treatment. And the site gave it the blaring-siren treatment because conservatives have been ready for a very long time to return to a familiar and comfortable opinion of Homeland Security: It must be stopped. \\n  \\n Advertisement \\n  \\n  \\n  \\n That opinion was in hibernation, then partial hibernation, for a long time. Before 9/11, the prevailing conservative/libertarian/Republican opinion of the national-security state—of any government effort to protect Americans at the point of a gun and the touch of a rubber glove—was mistrust. The second most common opinion was fear. And the return of those emotions is a lagging reaction to the fact that Republicans no longer have to toe the party line on homeland security. They can say what they think, which is that the state can\\'t be trusted. \\n  \\n It\\'s worth remembering that the idea of a cabinet-level Department of Homeland Security came from the Democratic Party just after the 9/11 attacks. (Just after 9/11, President Bush created an Office of Homeland Security within the White House.) It wasn\\'t until 2002 that the Republican Party latched on to the concept and took ownership of it. As they pushed DHS through the House, however, Republicans made concessions that demonstrated just how ambivalent they were about the idea of a massive new national-security bureaucracy. Plans for national ID cards and a system to inform on possible terrorists were killed by Republicans like then majority leader and current Tea Party icon Dick Armey. Certain homeland security proposals, he said, were \"not consistent with a free society.\" \\n  \\n At the time, only 12 Republicans voted against the House bill creating DHS. Most Republican candidates used their support of \"a strong DHS,\" which quickly became a byword for \"being serious about terrorism,\" to clobber Democrats who wanted the new federal workers hired to staff the new department to be unionized. This was not something conservatives believed in deeply. It was a useful—and, if you ask Max Cleland, successful—campaign issue. \\n  \\n There were always critics of the strategy. They simply didn\\'t have much pull while Bush was president. Angry criticism of the TSA, DHS, and the surveillance state came out of a rump of congressional Republicans, from think tanks and from talk radio hosts like Alex Jones and pundits like Andrew Napolitano. But none of this challenged Republicans\\' strategic thinking. The first victories of the conservative civil liberties crowd came in 2007 and 2008, when they successfully beat back a plan for a national ID card—technically, nationally compatible state IDs—that had been scrapped from the first DHS bill. \\n  \\n Tea Party activists like to date the backlash to big government to the 2008 passage of TARP. But the backlash against the TSA started a little earlier. According to Tom Blank, the deputy administrator of TSA in the post-9/11 years, the agency was always cognizant of how unpopular scanning could be. \\n  \\n \"I used to sit around and look at these images, dial them back, and ask myself how do I take this to Capitol Hill and not be thrown out on my head?\" said Blank. \"When [Bush\\'s second TSA administrator] Kip Hawley came in [in 2005], he changed that. He saw the politics of it and deep-sixed the program. He deep-sixed it. It got revived after the Christmas bomber.\" \\n  \\n The point about how full-body scanning got restarted is essential—it was the Obama administration picking up an idea that Republicans had cooled on. Republicans accused the administration of degrading security by dialing back war-on-terror prosecutions in the name of human rights; the response was a security measure that would affect all travelers randomly. So maybe the Drudge Report didn\\'t really invent a backlash against Napolitano. The backlash was inevitable. Republican trust in a sprawling and invasive security apparatus was always precarious. Its collapse leaves the TSA and the Obama administration with yet another libertarian, anti-state riot on their hands. \\n  \\n They have the media, too, for what that\\'s worth. Alex Altman\\'s take on the \"hysteria\" in Time dismissed the backlash as \"tailor-made for the Internet\\'s ephemeral obsessions\" and at odds with a Pew poll showing 81 percent of people accepting full-body scans. \"Sometimes the screams of an aggrieved minority drowns out the rest of the public,\" said Altman, \"and this may be one of those cases.\" \\n  \\n Which may be true. Or not. In 2009, the smart take on the rage against health-care reform was that it was ephemeral, tailor-made for the aggrieved minority, a bunch of anti-government yokels screaming about a policy they didn\\'t understand. Yet that rage clearly lasted long enough to hurt the Democrats at the polls this month. And health care reform at least had a cheering section in the liberal press. That press isn\\'t cheering on the TSA. Democrats aren\\'t particularly fond of the way the TSA operates. Pilots aren\\'t happy. In an age of right-wing backlashes to the state, the only surprise is that this took so long. \\n  \\n Like Slate on Facebook. Follow us on Twitter. \\n  \\n Like Slate Politics on Facebook.

They are objecting loudly to new airport security measures designed to detect bombs hidden under clothing. And they are blocking a Senate vote on a treaty with Russia that is critical to securing loose nukes and keeping Iran from gaining the bomb. \\n  \\n For Democrats, the opposition\\'s gamesmanship with the security should present an opportunity. Republicans seem to have entered a post-post-9/11 era, in which national security is no longer a higher priority than their interest in undermining President Obama. There\\'s no need to resort to the demagoguery once used against Democrats, but neither would it hurt the White House and congressional Democrats to point out that their opponents are trying to weaken Americans\\' security. \\n  \\n Let\\'s start with START, the proposed nuclear pact with Russia that Senate Republicans such as Jon Kyl (Ariz.) are attempting to derail, at least until the next Congress. Since the expiration of the previous START treaty last December, there have been no U.S. inspectors in Russia to keep an eye on the country\\'s thousands of nuclear warheads. If the Senate doesn\\'t come up with the 67 votes needed for ratification, says Travis Sharp of the Center for a New American Security, there\\'s a risk Russia will retaliate by removing its logistical support for the U.S. war in Afghanistan, abandoning its cooperation in preventing nuclear proliferation, and thwarting U.S. efforts to keep Iran from gaining nuclear weapons. \\n  \\n But don\\'t take his word for it. Listen to Richard Lugar, top Republican on the Senate Foreign Relations committee and one man who still puts the national interest above political considerations. \"We\\'re talking today about the national security of the United States of America,\" he pleaded on Wednesday. \"[T]his treaty must be ratified and be ratified in this session of the Congress.... We\\'re talking about thousands of warheads that are still there, an existential problem for our country. To temporize at this point I think is inexcusable.\" \\n  \\n Or listen to Bob Gates, the Bush/Obama defense secretary. \"The new START treaty has the unanimous support of America\\'s military leadership,\" he wrote in the Wall Street Journal, calling for a strong bipartisan majority to support the treaty because of \"the security it provides to the American people.\" \\n  \\n To borrow Bush\\'s phrase, are Republicans not interested in the security of the American people? \\n  \\n Then there\\'s the backlash over the new imaging and pat-downs being used to screen airport passengers for explosives. A CBS News poll found that 81 percent of Americans favor use of the new imaging machines, but Republican lawmakers feel otherwise. \\n  \\n In the House, Rep. Ron Paul (Tex.) has already introduced legislation rescinding the new security. Meanwhile, Republican senators, rediscovering their inner civil libertarians, this week took turns criticizing Transportation Security Administration chief John Pistole over the administration\\'s tightened security. \\n  \\n \"I wouldn\\'t want my wife to be touched in the way that these folks are being touched. I wouldn\\'t want to be touched that way,\" said Sen. George LeMieux (Fla.). \"I think weve gone too far.\" \\n  \\n Sen. Mike Johanns (Neb.) warned of a \"tipping point\" against security screening. \"Does that worry you, that maybe we\\'re at a point here where... people just thing you\\'ve overstepped?\" \\n  \\n Pistole reminded Johanns that \"the threats are real.\" \\n  \\n \"I\\'m thinking nothing\\'s going to change,\" Johanns complained. \\n  \\n Pistole\\'s response should shame Johanns and his colleagues. \"If your question is, do I understand the sensitivities of people? Yes. If you\\'re asking, am I going to change the policies? No, because I think that it is being informed by the latest intelligence, the latest efforts by terrorists to kill our people in the air. No, I\\'m not going to change those policies.\" \\n  \\n This may be the post-post-9/11 era, but Pistole, a career FBI guy, is still interested in the security of the American people.

The participants ranged in age from their early 20s to their mid-70s and included a mix of African-Americans and Caucasians. \\n  \\n The low-carb group, which reduced their carb consumption to about 28 percent of their daily calories, lost almost three times as much weight as the low-fat dieters who got about 40 to 45 percent of their calories from carbs. \\n  \\n The low-fat group lost about 4 pounds, whereas the low-carb group\\'s average weight loss was almost 12 pounds. Participants in the two groups were eating about the same amount of calories. \\n  \\n The study showed that modest reductions in carbohydrate consumption, down to about 28 to 30 percent of diet, could help tip the scales to weight loss. The makeup of the low-carb group\\'s diet was: 28 percent carbs 40 to 43 percent fat (twice as much poly and monounsaturated compared to saturated) about 28 percent protein The makeup of the low-fat group\\'s diet was: 28 percent fat 40 to 45 percent carbs 28 to 32 percent protein \\n  \\n Lydia Bazzano, one of the study authors and an associate professor of epidemiology at Tulane, says she had anticipated some difference in weight loss between the two groups. But the size of the effect — the nearly 8-pound difference in weight loss — was surprising, she says. \\n  \\n So, what kinds of meals were the low-carb dieters eating? \\n  \\n \"Typically in the morning they were eating eggs,\" says Bazzano. Other breakfast items included small portions of high-protein, high-fiber bread, with either butter or other kinds of oily spread. \\n  \\n As for lunch and dinner, the low-carb dieters ate lots of vegetables, salads and protein, including fish, chicken and some red meat. They had generous portions of healthy fats such as olive oils, canola and other plant-based oils. \\n  \\n Fat accounted for a sizable part of their diet: from 40 percent to 43 percent of their total daily calories, including about 12 percent from saturated fat. \\n  \\n Bazzano says with so many people still abiding by low-fat recommendations, a diet so high in fat might not sound like a good weight-loss strategy. \"It\\'s not the general perception,\" she says. \\n  \\n But, in fact, there are a spate of studies that have come to the same conclusion about the benefits of swapping a low-fat, high-carb strategy for a pattern of eating that emphasizes healthy fats and lower carbohydrate consumption. \\n  \\n It\\'s not just waistlines that respond. The low-carb, healthy fats approach has been shown to cut the risk of heart disease. \\n  \\n One big study published in the New England Journal of Medicine found that a Mediterranean diet rich in olive oil cut the risk of heart attacks and strokes by 30 percent, compared to a low-fat diet. \\n  \\n Research published last year in the Journal of the American Medical Association, which compared a low-glycemic-index diet — which minimizes refined starches — with a more traditional low-fat diet, also documented advantages. \\n  \\n \"We saw improvements in triglycerides, [good] cholesterol, and the possibility of lower chronic inflammation\" among the lower carb group, JAMA study author David Ludwig of Harvard Medical School and Boston Children\\'s Hospital told us. \\n  \\n Here\\'s the fascinating part: Ludwig also found that when people stopped eating so many refined carbohydrates, they burned off about 150 more calories per day, compared to those eating a higher carb, lower fat diet. \\n  \\n \"Too much refined carbohydrates — white bread, white rice, potato products — all the foods that crept into our diets as we\\'ve followed the low-fat craze has undermined our metabolism,\" says Ludwig. \\n  \\n In other words, the high-carb, low-fat pattern of eating \"caused us to become hungrier and burn off fewer calories,\" he says. \\n  \\n What\\'s happening in the body when we follow this pattern of eating is still the subject of much research, but Ludwig says the thinking goes like this: Eating too many carbs can overstimulate the release of insulin and direct more calories into storage in the fat cells. \\n  \\n \"It\\'s a double-whammy for weight gain,\" Ludwig says. \"We\\'ve been told for decades that if you don\\'t want fat on your body, don\\'t put fat into your body. It\\'s a very appealing notion, but the problem is it\\'s wrong.\" ||||| A low-carbohydrate diet is better for losing weight and may also be better for lowering the risk of heart disease than a low-fat diet, according to a new study. \\n  \\n While low-carb diets have outperformed other diets when it comes to weight loss, some researchers feared they might be worse for heart health because they tend to be high in fat. \\n  \\n The new study shows that with proper nutritional counseling, people can lose more weight and lower their risk factors for heart disease on a low-carbohydrate diet, said the lead author, Dr. Lydia Bazzano of Tulane University in New Orleans. \\n  \\n \"This study shows if you are overweight and have cardiovascular disease risk factors and haven\\'t had success on other diets, certainly a low-carbohydrate diet is worth a try,\" said Bazzano. \\n  \\n Carbohydrates are found in food and include sugar, fiber and starches that give the body energy. Some carbs - like those in whole grains and fruits - are healthier than others - like those in white bread and other processed foods. \\n  \\n Bazzano and her colleagues write in Annals of Internal Medicine that low-carb diets have become popular weight loss strategies in recent years. Studies on their effects on cardiovascular risk factors have produced mixed results, however. \\n  \\n For the new study, she and her colleagues recruited 148 obese men and women between the ages of 22 and 75. None of the participants had heart disease or diabetes. \\n  \\n Half were randomly assigned to follow a low-carbohydrate diet for a year, and the other half were assigned to a low-fat diet for a year. They were told to not change their physical activity throughout the trial. \\n  \\n All participants attended regular meetings where they learned about portion control, healthy eating and overall nutrition. They were also offered one meal-replacement bar or shake per day. \\n  \\n The only difference between the groups was the proportions of carbohydrate and fat in their diets. \\n  \\n Those in the low-carbohydrate group were told to eat at no more than 40 grams of digestible carbohydrates per day. (\"Digestible carbs\" equals total carbs minus total fiber.) \\n  \\n Those in the low-fat group were told not to get more than 30 percent of their daily energy from fat and no more than 55 percent of their daily energy from carbohydrates. \\n  \\n Overall, about four of every five participants were still following the diets 12 months later. \\n  \\n During that time, the researchers found, people on the low-carbohydrate diet lost more weight and more body fat than those on the low-fat diet. \\n  \\n The difference in lost weight between the two groups would represent about eight additional pounds. \\n  \\n Additionally, the researchers saw no increases in total cholesterol or \"bad\" LDL cholesterol between the two groups. Bazzano said that\\'s good news since some thought a low-carbohydrate diet would increase cholesterol levels. \\n  \\n Those in the low-carbohydrate group had lower levels of fat circulating in their blood and had lower scores on a measure often used to predict the risk of a heart attack or stroke within the next 10 years. \\n  \\n \"I thought that was a very striking finding,\" Bazzano said. She added that the score that predicts risk of future heart attacks and strokes was computed after the study was finished and is less reliable than the other risk factors they measured. \\n  \\n Dr. David Jenkins, who wasn\\'t involved in the study, told Reuters Health, \"This doesn’t look to me to say \\'eat all the meats you want to lower your carbohydrates.\\' That’s just one way to do it.\" \\n  \\n Instead, Jenkins said, people in this study appeared to improve their overall diets. For example, they were eating foods with healthier fats, such as nuts and beans. \\n  \\n He also said they seemed to eat more fiber and cut down on processed foods with more carbohydrates. \\n  \\n \"I think it’s another testament to what one can do with a more plant-based diet using the right macronutrient profile,\" said Jenkins of the Department of Nutritional Sciences at the University of Toronto and the Keenan Research Centre at St. Michael\\'s Hospital. \\n  \\n Bazzano agreed that the overall diets improved among the participants and they were encouraged to eat healthier forms of protein like chicken, fish, nuts and beans. \\n  \\n She also said her team is not sure why people on the low-carbohydrate diets lost more weight and had lower risk factors for heart disease after one year. It\\'s not clear, she added,if there would still be a difference after a longer period. \\n  \\n SOURCE: bit.ly/1qjI8OG Annals of Internal Medicine, online September 1, 2014. |||||',\n"," 'Sprint Nextel Corp. will begin selling the new version of the Apple iPhone in mid-October, people familiar with the matter said, filling a huge hole in the No. 3 U.S. carrier\\'s lineup and giving Apple Inc. another sales channel for its popular gadget. \\n  \\n The timing, however, indicates Apple\\'s new iPhone, which is expected to be called iPhone 5, will hit the market later than expected and too late to contribute to sales in Apple\\'s fiscal fourth quarter, which ends in September. Most observers had expected the device to arrive next month. \\n  \\n Sprint will get both the new iPhone 5 and the iPhone 4 but it\\'s unclear just how many new subscribers Sprint will be able to reel in come this fall, MarketWatch\\'s Dan Gallagher reports on Markets Hub. (Photo: AP Photo.) \\n  \\n The deal could help prop up the nation\\'s third-largest carrier and give AT&T Inc. more ammunition in its attempt to win regulatory approval for its proposed acquisition of No. 4 U.S. carrier T-Mobile USA Inc. \\n  \\n Verizon Wireless and AT&T, the two largest wireless carriers, measured by subscribers, will begin selling the phone in mid-October as well, according to two people familiar with the matter. \\n  \\n Sprint had more than 52 million subscribers at the end of the second quarter, compared with 106 million for Verizon and nearly 99 million for AT&T. \\n  \\n Sprint will begin selling the iPhone 5 in mid-October, closing a huge hole in the No. 3 U.S. carrier\\'s lineup and giving Apple another channel for selling its popular phone. Spencer Ante has details on The News Hub. \\n  \\n Landing the iPhone is a big win for Sprint, whose results have suffered without being able to sell the trend-setting device. AT&T has relied on versions of the Apple device to drive sales since 2007. This February, Verizon Wireless began selling the iPhone 4. Verizon Wireless is a joint venture of Verizon Communications Inc. and Vodafone Group PLC. \\n  \\n In the second quarter, Sprint blamed a decline in its contract subscribers on more pronounced \"competitive headwinds,\" most prominently, \"the first full quarter both major competitors offered the iPhone.\" \\n  \\n Sprint will also carry the iPhone 4, starting at the same time, one person familiar with the situation said. \\n  \\n Richard Doherty, director of the research firm Envisioneering Group, said that the addition of the iPhone would help Sprint retain many of its customers itching to upgrade. The iPhone will also increase foot traffic in Sprint stores, which should help the company to sell high-margin iPhone accessories. \"Sprint needs it,\" said Mr. Doherty. \"There are a lot of families that will embrace the iPhone.\" \\n  \\n That said, the deal could also hurt Sprint by helping AT&T improve its chances of winning approval from regulators for its $39 billion purchase of T-Mobile USA, said Marc Ostrau, a partner and co-chair of the antitrust and unfair competition group at law firm Fenwick & West. \\n  \\n \"It not only is likely to give Sprint a boost but also puts more focus on the increasing importance of device suppliers relative to carriers,\" said Mr. Ostrau. \\n  \\n Herbert Hovenkamp, a professor of law at the University of Iowa, said a Sprint iPhone would probably help AT&T\\'s efforts, but he said the impact depends on how much regulators determine the deal curbs AT&T\\'s ability to raise prices without losing too many sales. \\n  \\n \"The question is how much more competition do you get when you have two rivals rather than one,\" said Mr. Hovenkamp. \\n  \\n The cellphone business is increasingly driven by hot smartphones, which are growing more sophisticated and expensive. Apple commanded an average of more than $650 apiece for its iPhones last quarter. Carriers subsidize the difference between that cost and the phone\\'s $199 or $299 retail price, hoping to make up the difference with the data plans they sell over the course of two-year contracts customers must sign to get the subsidy. \\n  \\n Apple created additional leverage for itself by signing exclusive deals when it first launched the iPhone in 2007. In recent years, the company has changed strategy, inking deals with multiple carriers in countries around the world. \\n  \\n The new iPhone is expected to be similar to the current iPhone 4, but thinner and lighter with an improved digital camera and a new more sophisticated operating system. \\n  \\n Apple said in June that a new version of its mobile operating system would be available this fall, leading many analysts to conclude that an upgraded iPhone would be introduced at the same time. \\n  \\n On a July earnings conference call, Apple Chief Financial Officer Peter Oppenheimer said the company\\'s September quarter would be affected by \"a future product transition that we are not going to talk about today,\" increasing anticipation. \\n  \\n While Apple unveiled the iPhone 4 at its June developers\\' conference last year, its successor wasn\\'t ready in time for this year, according to a person briefed on Apple\\'s product plans. The company then aimed to launch a new iPhone by the end of September, though two people familiar with the situation previously told The Wall Street Journal that the phone could be delayed again if its contract manufacturer couldn\\'t improve its production yield rate. \\n  \\n Enlarge Image Close Bloomberg News Sprint, fighting to turn itself around after its disastrous merger with Nextel last decade, has managed to stem subscriber defections and improve customer service.

It only took Verizon Wireless a few months after launching its version of the iPhone 4 before it opted to apply similar data caps. \\n  \\n Sprint, which The Wall Street Journal reported today will be getting the iPhone 5 at the same time as AT&T; and Verizon in October, will likely follow the same path. \\n  \\n I have no first-hand knowledge of Sprint\\'s thinking on its successful--but taxing--offer of an all-you-can-eat data plan for its smartphones. A Sprint representative wasn\\'t immediately available to answer my questions. \\n  \\n But I do know that networks aren\\'t fundamentally different from each other, despite the marketing jargon and hype that surrounds them. Sprint doesn\\'t have any more capacity than Verizon and AT&T.; In fact, it may be in a worse position now because its unlimited-data offer is unique in the market, likely attracting the heaviest of users. \\n  \\n The carriers\\' switch to tiered plans doesn\\'t include existing unlimited-data customers, who have had the option to be grandfathered into an unlimited plan. You can see the strain the grandfathering is putting on the carriers, with both AT&T; and Verizon switching to language in their service agreements that allow them to throttle, or choke off, the connection speed when a user exceeds a certain threshold of data consumption. \\n  \\n Sprint is in a touchy spot because it has positioned itself as the unlimited carrier. Ads talk about the company\\'s truly limitless plans, and Chief Executive Dan Hesse has been featured on commercials deriding competitors\\' actions such as throttling. \\n  \\n As I\\'ve written, Verizon\\'s decision to switch to a capped plan has been a boon for Sprint. The carrier is the only remaining company to offer a truly unlimited-data plan, a rare marketing and competitive edge outside of cheaper prices. Even Sprint\\'s prepaid arm, Virgin Mobile, has decided to employ throttling. \\n  \\n But all good things have to come to an end. Speaking to a roundtable of bloggers and reporters last month, Hesse acknowledged that data traffic could eventually be an issue. \\n  \\n \"Nothing\\'s a guarantee that it\\'s forever,\" he said at the time. \\n  \\n For Sprint, the choice is a trade-off: keep the unlimited-data plan and spur additional customer growth, or cut back on the plans and ease the need to invest in more capital for the network. Its decision may indicate whether it is favoring the consumer or Wall Street. \\n  \\n When I wrote about Sprint eventually dropping the unlimited-data plan, analysts gave it a year to 18 months before a change would happen. But with the iPhone becoming available to Sprint customers, that timetable could be accelerated. Thanks to its more affordable data plans, Sprint has a higher base of smartphone customers than its rivals--roughly half of its total customers. \\n  \\n While it has gotten used to dealing with the bandwidth-intensive Android phone, Sprint may be in for another pounding, once more customers start upgrading their basic phones for the iPhone. \\n  \\n And even if the iPhone isn\\'t significantly more data-hungry than its Android counterparts, Sprint may use the iPhone\\'s reputation as an excuse to close off the unlimited-data spigot. \\n  \\n So what does that mean for customers? If the iPhone does come out for Sprint, hop on an unlimited-data plan while you can (and thus get grandfathered in). The plan may not be around much longer. |||||',\n"," 'Neil Patrick Harris\\' hot streak as the 21st century awards-show answer to Johnny Carson hit a few speed bumps with this year\\'s wildly hit-or-miss television honors. \\n  \\n Jeff Daniels beat out Bryan Cranston. Bobby Cannavale trumped Aaron Paul. Tony Hale mopped the floor with the Modern Family guys. And Stephen Colbert finally nudged out Jon Stewart for variety-show supremacy. So with so many unexpected wins, why was the 65th Primetime Emmy Awards telecast such a bloated bore? Chalk it up to tonal inconsistency? Misconceived production numbers? Too many protracted pretaped segments at the expense of spontaneity? An overload of solemnity? \\n  \\n Perhaps Don Cheadle inadvertently hit it on the head during a look back a half-century to the momentous events of 1963, when he acknowledged “television’s active role in allowing us to mourn collectively and begin to heal.” That’s a noble sentiment in the intended context of the John F. Kennedy assassination. But in such a moribund ceremony, any mention of mourning felt awkwardly appropriate. It didn’t take the Breaking Bad meth dancers -- yes, really -- to point up the uncomfortable paradox of television’s best being celebrated in a night of spectacularly messy TV. \\n  \\n PHOTOS: Emmys\\' Best and Worst Moments \\n  \\n As the man in the firing line, Neil Patrick Harris will likely cop a lot of flak. But with so many blundering producing decisions intruding on his limited time at the podium, the host didn’t really stand a chance. \\n  \\n Harris has four lauded turns as Tony Awards emcee under his belt, plus a previous gig fronting the Emmys in 2009. He knows what he’s doing. His insouciant irreverence hit the mark in an intro segment in which he binge-watched the entire TV season. Ditto when his opening monologue was hijacked by previous hosts (Jimmy Kimmel, Jane Lynch, Jimmy Fallon, Conan O’Brien) and by front-row hecklers Tina Fey and Amy Poehler, demanding that he strip down and start twerking. Making that sabotage part of the master plan of Kevin Spacey, in character as House of Cards’ reptilian Frank Underwood, was a droll touch. And somehow Harris’ humor and charm failed to provide much glue. (Truth be told, he was also part of the producing team, which makes him far from blameless.) \\n  \\n The expected opening song-and-dance number failed to materialize until midshow. By the time it did, the mood had been so thoroughly flattened that Harris, 16 back-up dancers, Nathan Fillion and Sarah Silverman faced an uphill battle to milk much amusement out of the routine glitz of “The Number in the Middle of the Show.” Even worse was the choreography segment, with a faux-reality setup leading to thematic dance numbers for each of the drama nominees -- a throwback to the good old, bad old days when Debbie Allen choreographed the Oscars. \\n  \\n PHOTOS: Emmys Red Carpet Arrivals \\n  \\n When Harris’ How I Met Your Mother castmates turned up in a pretaped mock-infomercial for The Ryan Seacrest Center for Excessive Hosting Disorder, dragging in Arsenio Hall as part of their intervention, the irony was agonizing. \\n  \\n Too often, such labored filler segments merely ate up time, meaning the award recipients were played off almost as soon as they began speaking. Shorter acceptance speeches normally are a good thing, a memo that Nurse Jackie winner Merritt Wever appeared to have gotten with her succinct: “Thank you so much. I gotta go. Bye.” But a few more discursive comments might have helped stave off the weird pall that hung over much of the ceremony. \\n  \\n In one inspired bit early on, Hale returned to the stage soon after his supporting actor in a comedy win for Veep, sycophantically flanking his “boss,” Julia Louis-Dreyfus, when she was honored for the same show. Cutting to their co-star Anna Chlumsky madly texting in the audience only made the joke funnier. Michael Douglas also scored some laughs with his innuendo-laden acceptance speech for Behind the Candelabra, acknowledging that the movie was a “two-hander” and giving his co-star Matt Damon the choice of “the bottom or the top” for his half of the award. Gracious remarks by class acts such as James Cromwell and Ellen Burstyn were like invigorating breaths of fresh air -- likewise the welcome appearances of Bob Newhart, who showed that less is more. \\n  \\n PHOTOS: THR\\'s Emmys Instagram Photos \\n  \\n But every moment of genuine levity had to contend with another deep plunge into self-important sobriety. Spreading the “In Memoriam” salutes throughout the show was a large part of that problem, laying such a thick carpet of gloom that it made much of Harris’ material seem smug. \\n  \\n During the runup to Sunday’s ceremony, news that Glee star Cory Monteith was to be given a special tribute prompted some discontent, suggesting that, by contrast, lumping such iconic faces as Jack Klugman and Larry Hagman into the collective obit was doing those TV veterans a disservice. But it was impossible not to be moved by the heartfelt sincerity of Jane Lynch’s salute to her late Glee co-star. \\n  \\n Other tributes included Michael J. Fox’s bow to Family Ties creator Gary David Goldberg; Robin Williams’ nod to fellow comedian Jonathan Winters, with whom he worked on Mork & Mindy; Edie Falco’s tearful farewell to her Sopranos husband James Gandolfini; and most affecting of all, Rob Reiner’s loving words for his All in the Family mother-in-law, Jean Stapleton. In a year of countless sad losses for television, the Emmys clearly set out to acknowledge the passing of key figures who touched different generations. The intention was honorable, even if some major names ended up seeming like also-rans. But the complete absence of clips from either the standalone tributes or the group acknowledgement robbed them of emotional resonance. \\n  \\n PHOTOS: Emmys Fashion: The Top 10 Best Dressed \\n  \\n The 1963 remembrance was too rushed to have much impact, playing like a promo for a more interesting PBS special. The first-ever African-American Emmy acting nominee, Diahann Carroll, appeared onstage with this year’s contender Kerry Washington to acknowledge how far television had come in terms of racial inclusiveness. But again, this gesture was more symbolic than meaningful. \\n  \\n In the evening’s most anticipated musical interlude, Elton John donned one of his old glittery Captain Fantastic jackets to pay tribute to Liberace. But the choice of a forgettable new song with only the most tenuous connection to the Behind the Candelabra subject made this another black hole in a ceremony littered with them. \\n  \\n The big drag at the Emmys has always been the deja vu factor of the same winners year after year. Claire Danes again? Jim Parsons again? And despite edgier contenders in Louie, Girls and Veep, another best comedy win for Modern Family was gruesomely inevitable. Given that USA is about to start syndicating season-one reruns of that sitcom -- the last time the show’s writing really excelled -- the ho-hum award felt somehow right. \\n  \\n This was an Emmy telecast so plodding, lifeless and just plain glum that even the overdue best drama win for Breaking Bad failed to provide a lift at the end of the show. ||||| \"Modern Family\" creator Steven Levitan summed up the 65th Primetime Emmy Awards telecast when he accepted another outstanding comedy award for the show.\"This may be the saddest Emmys of all time, but we could not be happier,\" he said.The CBS telecast, hosted with gusto by Neil Patrick Harris, was smothered by five \"in memoriam\" tributes to individuals as well as a montage late in the telecast. It was, in a word, a bummer.Harris tried to bring up the energy with jokes and a mid-broadcast song-and-dance number called \"The Number in the Middle of the Show.\" But nothing seemed to help. Every time the show got moving, a tribute cast a pall over the proceedings.Most of the presenter banter was strained and only a few acceptance speeches drew laughs. Here are the night\\'s best moments, which were few. (Click through the gallery at top of page for images from the telecast.)Accepting the variety series Emmy for \"The Colbert Report,\" Colbert cracked, \"It\\'s a cliche to say it\\'s an honor just to be nominated. It\\'s more than that; it\\'s also a lie.

He whispered names and comments into her ear so she could complete her speech.Merritt Wever, a surprise supporting actress winner for \"Nurse Jackie,\" was rendered pretty much speechless, thus delivering the night\\'s most honest and brief acceptance. \"Thank you so much,\" she said. \"I gotta go. Bye.\"Amy Poehler and Tina Fey show why they are the funniest ladies of the moment, again. During Harris\\' opening skit in which past hosts offered him advice, the women cat call him from the audience with comments like,\"Take your pants off! And twerk it!\" When he said that would be degrading, Poehler responded, \"It might be degrading, but we would be de-grateful.\"Diahann Carroll, who was the first African-American to win in Emmy way back when, showed she\\'s still a pro. \"It\\'s been such a long time since I\\'ve been standing in this place, I don\\'t know what to do,\" Carroll said. \"But the men are much more beautiful than when I was doing television. I don\\'t know where you came from, but I\\'m very happy to see you.\" ||||| First, our apologies: we may have hyped this year’s Emmy Awards as a lighter Sunday-night-programming alternative to Breaking Bad. Aside from the trophies, and the odd sexual-innuendo-tinged acceptance speech from Michael Douglas, however, the vibe inside the Nokia Theater’s Emmydome was not that upbeat. (To quote Patton Oswalt: “That was one soul-crushing slab of televised darkness. Over on cable, however, @BreakingBad_AMC was amazing.”) How could it be, with the steady stream of in-memoriam segments that stopped just long enough for a series of less relevant downers including, but not limited to, a Beatles cover performed by Carrie Underwood, a U.S.-history lesson from Don Cheadle, and a tribute to Liberace by Elton John? It was all so torturous that when Bob Newhart interrupted the downcast proceeding, we don’t even remember what for, Al Pacino—looking as though he had just roused himself from a two-hour slumber—led the audience in a standing ovation, as if to say, “Yay for the living!” \\n  \\n  \\n  \\n But somewhere in all of that Emmy muckety-muck, there were some genuinely brilliant surprises. The first being Merritt Wever’s very deserved, but very unexpected, win in the supporting-actress-in-a-comedy category for her work on Nurse Jackie. Up against Modern Family favorites Sofía Vergara and Julie Bowen, the young actress was so shocked by the win that all she could mutter at the podium was, “Thanks so much. I gotta go, bye.” A close second in the awesome-acceptance-speech department came from Julia Louis-Dreyfus, who collected her comedic-actress Emmy with Veep co-star (and supporting comedic-actor winner) Tony Hale in tow. Assuming the role of Gary, Louis-Dreyfus’s aide on the HBO series, Hale stood behind her while she accepted her Emmy to hold her bag (a recurring Veep joke) and remind her to thank her family. \\n  \\n Joining Wever with their own surprise wins were Jeff Daniels in the dramatic-actor category (where he was up against such heavy-hitting nominees as Mad Men’s Jon Hamm, Breaking Bad’s Bryan Cranston, and Homeland’s Damian Lewis) and Boardwalk Empire’s Bobby Cannavale in the dramatic-supporting-actor race (which featured Breaking Bad’s Aaron Paul, Homeland’s Mandy Patinkin, and Game of Thrones’ Peter Dinklage). Like last year, Modern Family won the best-comedy-series title, and Claire Danes took the best-dramatic-actress award for Homeland. In groundbreaking developments, Netflix secured its first Emmy, for direction of a drama series, which went to David Fincher for House of Cards. Michael Douglas predictably took the best-actor-in-a-miniseries-or-movie trophy for his portrayal of Liberace in HBO’s Behind the Candelabra. Explaining that he wanted to split his award with co-star Matt Damon, who played Liberace’s real-life lover Scott Thorson, Douglas joked, “Matt, you really deserve half of this. So do you want the bottom or the top?” \\n  \\n  \\n  \\n Breaking Bad won two awards—supporting actress in a drama series for Anna Gunn and the top drama title at the end of the night. Sadly for Game of Thrones fans, this meant that neither Emilia Clarke nor the fantasy show won in their nominated categories. Similarly defeated was Mad Men, which unfathomably failed to clinch a single award tonight. While on the subject of injustices, it seems unfair to tease Emmy viewers with several minutes’ worth of Tina Fey and Amy Poehler—who appeared early in the telecast to heckle host Neil Patrick Harris—only to leave us with three relentlessly depressing hours of programming. \\n  \\n  \\n  \\n Meanwhile, it bears noting that Neil Patrick Harris—a consummate pro—expertly M.C.’d the proceedings, brightening them up wherever he could. Unfortunately for him, Emmy producers had a somewhat dour agenda for the evening, which left this viewer, at least, feeling like one of the night’s biggest losers. ||||| We don’t ask much of the Primetime Emmy Awards. Nobody ever gets one of these three-hour statuette dispensaries completely right, but the Emmys always seem as though they’d be the easiest of all the awards shows to pull off — mostly because the likelihood of culturally disruptive twerking is very, very low, which means the Emmys are the awards show no one ever remembers 18 hours later. \\n  \\n So what happened Sunday night during CBS’s anemic and often awkward Emmys telecast, hosted by Neil Patrick Harris? (Or let me put it another way: I had to next-day “Breaking Bad” for this?) \\n  \\n Everyone’s favorite messed-up meth saga did at last win the best drama award, so the night wasn’t a total wash, but all those highfalutin theses about the Netflix-y future of television failed to materialize. Claire Danes won lead actress (drama) for Showtime’s “Homeland” for the second year in a row, and, inexplicably, Jeff Daniels won lead actor (drama) for HBO’s “The Newsroom.” \\n  \\n “Modern Family” won best comedy series for what seems like the squillionth time, but it is really just the fourth. HBO’s Washington-based comedy “Veep” took two acting awards — Tony Hale for supporting actor, and Julia Louis-Dreyfus for lead actress the second straight year. And Anna Gunn won for supporting actress (drama) for AMC’s “Breaking Bad.” \\n  \\n That’s most of the news, now for the snooze, starting with a dreary opening sketch that featured Harris locking himself in a multi-screen chamber to binge the entire 2012-13 season of every television show in a matter of minutes. \\n  \\n 1 of 57 Full Screen Autoplay Close Skip Ad × Emmys red carpet fashion: View Photos Buttoned-up gowns felt fresh compared with the amount of skin seen on carpets of late. — Cara Kelly Caption A hint of modesty infused the red carpet at the 65th annual Emmy Awards on Sunday night.

The joke just got staler when an unamused Kevin Spacey, the star of Netflix’s hit “House of Cards,” turned and addressed the camera as House Majority Whip Francis Underwood, his fictional character from the show. \\n  \\n Later, Harris’s “How I Met Your Mother” co-stars confronted him in an intervention for “EHD” (excessive hosting disorder), treatable only at the “Ryan Seacrest Center for Excessive Hosting.” \\n  \\n Halfway through the evening, Harris finally brought out the jaunty song-and-dance routines, the main symptom of his EHD, with a number called “The Number in the Middle of the Show.” (Sample lyric: “The Emmy Awards are three hours long / Now there’s three minutes less to go.”) One can’t imagine a flashier way to demonstrate that Hollywood’s awards-show writers desperately need to think of a way to tell jokes that aren’t about telling jokes; to stage a show that’s not only about the show. \\n  \\n The best line of the evening came very early on from Merritt Wever, who seemed so shocked at winning the supporting actress Emmy for a comedy show (“Nurse Jackie”) that she went with her flusteredness and said: “I gotta go, bye.” \\n  \\n The rest of us (well, some of us) gotta stay, alas, in a listless position on the couch while the Emmys poked along as flatly as possible. The banter had no flair for comedy. The tributes — including short monologues from Robin Williams, Rob Reiner, Michael J. Fox and Jane Lynch (honoring the recent deaths of comic actor Jonathan Winters, “All in the Family’s” Jean Stapleton, producer Gary David Goldberg and “Glee’s” Cory Monteith) sometimes seemed stiff and, most curiously, clip-less. \\n  \\n Lynch said that Monteith was “a beautiful soul. He was not perfect, which many of us here can relate to. . . . Tonight we remember Cory for all he was and mourn the loss of what he could have been.” That was supposed to be one of the evening’s most moving moments, and it only sort of was. Edie Falco also encountered a similar struggle in a tribute to “The Sopranos” star James Gandolfini, trying to make what was on the teleprompter sound as authentic as the pain she so clearly feels at losing a friend. \\n  \\n More strangeness: Elton John performed a song that he said was a tribute to Liberace, which is topical because of all the nominations for HBO’s “Behind the Candelabra,” a film didn’t exactly leave everyone who saw it with a warm feeling about the flamboyant pianist. (“Behind the Candelabra” went on to win three big awards, for best miniseries/movie, best director for Steven Soderbergh and best actor for its star Michael Douglas, who tried to perk up his acceptance speech with jokes about gay sex.) And somewhere in this now-blurry Emmys night, Carrie Underwood performed the Beatles’ song “Yesterday,” as a tribute to all the things that happened during or close to the year 1963 (the March on Washington; the John F. Kennedy assassination), because . . .?

(Associated Press) \\n  \\n A dime made in 1873 has cost someone a pretty penny: It sold for $1.6 million at auction. \\n  \\n An anonymous bidder won the pristine coin, said Chris Napolitano, president of Stack\\'s Bowers Galleries, which auctioned it during an American Numismatic Association convention. With a 15 percent buyer\\'s fee tacked on, the final price for the coin was $1.84 million, he said. \\n  \\n The rare coin was minted in Carson City, Nev., during a one-day run of dimes. \\n  \\n \"Generally speaking, in the coin auction business, you might get a couple of people fighting each other\" as they bid, he said Friday. \"On this one, we had four or five buyers over a million dollars. We had a fair amount of buyers pursuing it.\" \\n  \\n The 1873-CC \"No Arrows\" Liberty Seated dime was auctioned Thursday night. It\\'s part of the Battle Born Collection, which contained one of every coin struck in Carson City before the mint there closed in 1893. \\n  \\n All 111 pieces were auctioned off Thursday night, fetching a total of nearly $10 million. \\n  \\n ___ \\n  \\n Online: \\n  \\n Stack\\'s Bowers: http://stacksbowers.com/ ||||| Add up their face value, and the 111 rare coins in the \"Battle Born Collection\" amount to under $600. \\n  \\n But throw in their lure to coin enthusiasts - each struck in the Carson City Mint between 1870 and 1893 with the most prized coin the only known 1873 \"No Arrows\" Seated Liberty dime to exist - and the price tag soars. \\n  \\n Their owner, an anonymous Nevadan, could earn $11 million-$15 million at auction next week in Philadelphia, and a Reno coin dealer assisting him in the process says it will be a once-in-a-lifetime event. \\n  \\n \"This is my Olympic moment,\" Rusty Goe, owner of Southgate Coins, said Tuesday of the upcoming sale, part of the Rarities Night Auction at the American Numismatic Association\\'s World\\'s Fair of Money Convention. \"This is the biggest event that\\'s ever happened to me in my 30-year career as a coin collector.\" \\n  \\n Goe serves as a paid consultant to the collection\\'s owner, whom Goe refers to only as \"Mr. Battle Born\" after Nevada\\'s state motto. \\n  \\n Until the coins are sold individually at auction, they remain the only complete collection of coins made in the Carson City Mint, Goe said. They represent each of the 111 different date-and-denomination combinations issued from the Mint before it closed in 1893 in what is now the home of the Nevada State Museum. \\n  \\n The coins range from $5, $10 and $20 gold pieces to silver dollars, half-dollars, quarters, 20-cent pieces and, what Goe describes as the \"king coin,\" the dime featuring a seated liberty figure with a crucial feature: no arrows on each side of the 1873 stamp. \\n  \\n As the only known survivor of 12,400 coins minted, Goe said, it alone could fetch anywhere from $1.5 million to $4 million. \\n  \\n He should know: He once owned the dime, he said, buying it in 2004 for $891,250 and later selling it to the current owner for $1 million. \\n  \\n \"It\\'s the show-stopper, the cornerstone of the collection,\" Goe said. \"I got a good deal on it and I passed a good deal on to Mr. Battle Born.\" \\n  \\n The auction\\'s success could be affected by potential buyers\\' confidence at the moment with market conditions, Goe said, adding, \"We just won\\'t know for sure until then. We\\'ll see how close we come to our pre-sale estimates.\" \\n  \\n Either way, Goe hopes to use the event as a showcase for Nevada and the Carson City Mint\\'s opening at the height of the Comstock Lode era. \\n  \\n He\\'s already convinced Stack\\'s Bowers Galleries of Irvine, Calif., which will put on the auction, to print a separate catalog on the Battle Born Collection in addition to the main publication for participants. \\n  \\n And Goe has written articles for Coin World magazine and helped Stack\\'s Bowers organize a seven-city tour of the collection over the past year leading up to next Thursday\\'s auction. \\n  \\n He also said a bit of historic irony has not been lost: The Philadelphia Mint, the nation\\'s first opened in 1792, opposed creating a Carson City branch when the issue was debated in Congress in the 1860s. \\n  \\n \"They said, why do we want to put a mint in that heathen territory, a Wild West area like that? So for this one night, Carson City will steal the show from the Philadelphia Mint,\" he said. |||||',\n"," 'And, contrary to popular belief, people in open or polyamorous relationships aren’t more sexually satisfied: 71% of people in polyamorous or open relationships are satisfied with their sex life compared to 82% of people in monogamous relationships and 80% of people who are married, in civil unions or partnerships.

Individuals in open relationships were significantly less satisfied and less committed to their relationship than their monogamous counterparts. \\n  \\n They also reported lower levels of passionate love and fewer jealous cognitions than monogamous people and also scored marginally lower on the index of behavioral jealousy than monogamous individuals. \\n  \\n The findings appear in the current issue of Perspectives on Psychological Science. \\n  \\n  ||||| Sex is a big part of most romances, whether a marriage or a more experimental union.

People who live together (as couples with children often do) have readier access to sex than those in relationships who don’t live together. The EU survey only found 275 people, or 2.5% of the total, who said they were in open relationships. \\n  \\n Age and gender also affect sex-life satisfaction. Men overall reported a slight increase in satisfaction as age increased, while women’s satisfaction remained stable. For both genders, the highest peak was between the ages of 25 and 30. And though not every country in the EU provided enough respondents to produce a statistically significant finding, some that did showed marked differences. Spain proved to be the most sexually satisfied country with 41% of people saying they were “very satisfied” with their sex lives, while in Germany that number was 38%. In Poland only 23% said they were ”very satisfied,” compared to 28% in Italy and 29% in both the UK and France. \\n  \\n Opening up a relationship can be about more than sex. Advocates talk (paywall) about the deep trust forged by letting one’s partner have other relationships, and the intellectual stimulation and support gained from multiple romantic connections. But the surveys indicate that multiple partners may well not trump one really great one in the bedroom department. |||||',\n"," 'Gunfire rang out at the Forysth County Courthouse Friday after a man opened fire on a deputy, injuring him in the leg. The gunman was shot and killed a short time later. \\n  \\n  \\n  \\n Forsyth County Sheriff Duane Piper said the shooter, Dennis Marx, walked into Forsyth County Administration Building on East Main Street at about 10:30 a.m. and opened fire. He was armed with an assault rifle, according to authorities. Piper said Marx threw stop sticks on the road so that cars could not approach. \\n  \\n  \\n  \\n Marx was approached by deputy Daniel Rush who he then shot in the leg, Piper confirmed. \\n  \\n “The only way I can describe it is in a frontal assault on our court house,” Piper said. \\n  \\n Piper said Rush was taken to North Fulton Hospital in Roswell with non-life threatening injuries. \\n  \\n “From the video, it looks like he saw that deputy, swerved to try and run over the deputy. The deputy engaged him. He was shooting at Mr. Marx in the vehicle, Mr. Marx was shooting through the windshield at the deputy,” Piper said. \\n  \\n  \\n  \\n The SWAT team, which was on its way to a separate incident, arrived at the courthouse within 37 seconds. Marx was shot dead in front of the court house a short time later. \\n  \\n None of the other deputies involved in the incident were injured. \\n  \\n  \\n  \\n Piper described Marx’s home as a “bomb.” When officers entered the home Friday night, they found pipe bombs and other incendiary devices but none were booby-trapped to go off. \\n  \\n  \\n  \\n The sheriff said evidence showed that Marx had not been living at his home for more than a week and instead had been staying at a hotel. Piper said it will take hours to clear the courthouse. \\n  \\n “It\\'s kind of creepy to find out a whacko lives in your neighborhood,” Jane Bizzell said. She along with others was not allowed into the neighborhood. Neighbor Dorothy Varano who lived up the street from Marx said police visited her home a number of times throughout the day and told her to stay indoors for her safety. \\n  \\n But learning the house was filled with explosives made Browning wonder about her now deceased neighbor. \\n  \\n “I know a lot of people build up a lot of hatred, but I think he built up a double dose to do what he did,” said Margaret Browning. \\n  \\n The gunman\\'s attorney told Channel 2 she was representing him until Thursday, when she withdrew because he was unsatisfied with her negotiating skills. He was due in court on Friday for marijuana and firearms charges. The attorney said the man was a gun buyer and trader. \\n  \\n “His emotional state was very fragile. He was very sensitive, very, very, scared. He has no prior criminal history. He was obsessed with not going to jail,” said Marx’s former attorney Ann Shafer. \\n  \\n The area is still closed as police investigate and drivers are asked to avoid the area of downtown Cumming until further notice. \\n  \\n Rush posted on his Facebook page that he was “ok.” \\n  \\n One construction worker was just feet away when the shooting happened. Gary Womack described the situation as intense. \\n  \\n “It was unreal, like being in the wild west,” Womack said. ||||| Story highlights \"It was very close to being a catastrophe,\" sheriff says \\n  \\n A deputy underwent surgery after being shot in the leg \\n  \\n Dennis Marx was armed with gas grenades, assault rifle, and spike strips, police say \\n  \\n Sheriff: Carrying flexible handcuffs, he appeared intent on taking over courthouse \\n  \\n Dennis Marx wore body armor and a gas mask.

Shot twice in the leg, the deputy was the only person wounded despite what the sheriff called \"a full frontal assault.\" \\n  \\n \"It was very close to being a major catastrophe,\" Piper said. \"The deputy that was shot ... averted what, I think, would have been a lot more deaths.\" \\n  \\n Swift, significant response to attack \\n  \\n Marx was supposed to be at the Forsyth County Courthouse in Cumming. Court documents show he faced 11 felony charges -- 10 of them related to the manufacture, possession and sale of illicit drugs, including marijuana, plus one count of having a firearm while in the commission of a felony -- dating back to August 2011. \\n  \\n According to the sheriff\\'s office, he was expected to enter a plea Friday before Chief Superior Court Judge Jeffrey Bagley. \\n  \\n Needless to say, he never made it. \\n  \\n Instead, around 10 a.m. Friday, Marx drove up to the courthouse, threw out \"homemade spike strips\" to delay any police response, and tried to run over the deputy, Piper said. \\n  \\n The deputy -- a 30-year veteran whose duties include canvassing the scene outside the courthouse -- opened fire, and Marx returned fire through his windshield. \\n  \\n He didn\\'t stop with bullets. According to the sheriff, Marx tossed tear gas grenades, smoke grenades and pepper spray grenades -- something he could do more easily with his gas mask strapped on. \\n  \\n Despite this barrage of weapons, the sheriff\\'s deputy was able to distract Marx, to slow him.

They went to Marx\\'s home in Cumming, a small city about 35 northeast of downtown Atlanta, with every expectation that it was booby trapped. \\n  \\n As Piper said: \"Last time we were at the home, we were suspicious because it had been booby trapped before.\" \\n  \\n Once they finally made their way in and cleared the house, they found homemade explosives, according to a law enforcement source. It wasn\\'t clear whether those were attempted booby traps. \\n  \\n A preliminary investigation found that Marx hadn\\'t been in his Cumming home for about 10 days. Besides that, little is known about him beyond that he began working at the Transportation Security Administration in October 2002, according to a U.S. official, and left either the next year or in 2004. \\n  \\n The sheriff said Friday that he and others weren\\'t ready yet to discuss Marx\\'s motive or his thinking. \\n  \\n That said, Piper said it was evident that Marx \"came prepared to stay a while.\" \\n  \\n \"We don\\'t know who he was coming to the courthouse for, but with the flex ties and the restraining devices he had with him,\" said the sheriff. \"We have to assume that he was there to occupy the courthouse.\" \\n  \\n Who is the student who pounded on the Seattle gunman? \\n  \\n Canada shooting: Suspect yelled \\'I\\'m done\\' at time of arrest \\n  \\n Navy seals off Virginia military hospital in hunt for stabbing suspect |||||']"]},"metadata":{},"execution_count":11}]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"E9Jq3zP0mcIs","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1629732067306,"user_tz":-480,"elapsed":342,"user":{"displayName":"Lin Qiwei","photoUrl":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AOh14Gg7Y5XhKXvLeCQIWyx0AC4rGepdGbRR1Wm8LkA61A=s64","userId":"12577342240101728853"}},"outputId":"f3dd60a5-b0d0-4850-ebaf-35e5a60aa008"},"source":["eval_dataset['summary']"],"execution_count":12,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["['– The Da Vinci Code has sold so many copies—that would be at least 80 million—that it\\'s bound to turn up in book donation piles.

The aides say they were told by the Department of Veterans Affairs that the VA will not be making retroactive payments to veterans who were underpaid for their housing allowance because it would mean reviewing around 2 millions claims, further delaying implementation of a new system, which has already been pushed back to Dec. 2019. Under the Forever GI Bill signed into law by President Trump last year, students are supposed to be paid housing allowance based on where they take the most classes, not on where the school\\'s main campus is located. Tanya Ang, vice president of Veterans Education Success, tells the Military Times that the VA\\'s excuse of retroactive payments creating too much work isn\\'t good enough. \"That could be hundreds of dollars for some students—per month,\" she says. \"If this was a disability benefit, this would never fly.\" The issue, which is the result of new legislation being introduced before the VA\\'s outdated computer system could handle it, has contributed to a backlog of claims that has forced some veterans facing financial hardship to abandon their studies, the Tennessean reports.

It wasn\\'t to be, but according to an interview given by five of his men in 1602, they did find something staggering: a \"great settlement\" some five miles long that housed at least 20,000 people, an ancestral Wichita Indian town called Etzanoa. But French explorers in the region 100 years later found no sign of those people, sowing confusion among latter-day historians. Donald Blakeslee, an archaeologist with Wichita State University, says he\\'s cleared it all up: Etzanoa did exist, he claims, once thriving where the Walnut and Arkansas Rivers meet in Arkansas City, Kansas. Per a university press release, things got off the ground with a new and more correct transcription of centuries-old Spanish documents by the University of California, Berkeley\\'s Cibola Project. Prior translation errors caused \"many archaeological discoveries in the area [to be] misinterpreted,\" per the release. In 2015, Blakeslee noted that a geographic description of a 1601 ambush described in a Spanish account had to have occurred where the rivers joined. And, indeed, a search there turned up small iron cannon balls, reported the Kansas City Star at the time. If Blakeslee is right, the \"long-lost city\" would be second only to Cahokia on the list of biggest prehistoric Native American sites, reports the Wichita Eagle.

When Tannen Campbell was hired by Magic Leap in 2015, the Florida company had no women in leadership roles and its only idea to make its product female-friendly was to release a pink version, according to Forbes. The lawsuit filed by Campbell following her firing in December describes a \"macho bullying atmosphere,\" Business Insider reports. That allegedly includes tolerating sexist and offensive behavior, such as telling new hires to stay away from \"Orientals, Old People, and Ovaries\" and having the only female character in a centerpiece app \"on her knees grovelling at the heroes.\" Furthermore, Campbell alleges her efforts to change the culture at Magic Leap were consistently thwarted. The lawsuit states Campbell was asked to put together a presentation on the lack of gender diversity at the company, but it took seven months for Magic Leap\\'s chief executive to show up for the presentation, and he left in the middle of it. Campbell says she and other female employees were ignored when giving input on the design of the product and its marketing.

The idea is that finger lengths change depending on exposure to testosterone in utero, and it\\'s known as the \"2D:4D\" ratio. A lower ratio—where the second digit is shorter than the fourth—indicates \"greater androgen exposure.\" In the journal Clinical Anatomy, researchers write that others have previously suggested a link between androgen exposure in the womb and schizophrenia; they take that one step further, hypothesizing the ratio could be predictive of schizophrenia in males. Then they set out to test that hypothesis: In their small study, researchers analyzed the finger lengths of 103 Turkish male patients diagnosed with schizophrenia and 100 healthy male controls. They found \"significant differences between schizophrenia and control groups concerning the ratio ... in both hands,\" the researchers report in a press release. The findings occupy opposite ends of the spectrum: The right-hand 2D:4D ratio was \"significantly higher\" among the schizophrenia group and the left-hand ratio was \"significantly lower\"—suggesting the two are opposites, perhaps because testosterone \"affects finger ratios differently as it acts in different ways on the left and right hemispheres of the brain,\" per the study. As for those ratios, the researchers found the size of the ratio in the left hand could indicate the severity of negative symptoms in patients.

Last week on Slate, David Weigel made a similar point: “Before 9/11, the prevailing conservative/libertarian/Republican opinion of the national-security state—of any government effort to protect Americans at the point of a gun and the touch of a rubber glove—was mistrust.” But we’re now in, Milbank writes, “the post-post-9/11 era ,” and “for Democrats, the opposition\\'s gamesmanship with the security should present an opportunity.

Refined carbohydrates—found in processed foods like white breads, white rice, and pastas—tend to be loaded with sugar, which messes with our metabolisms, making it harder to burn calories. Eating nearly half your calories via healthy fats, on the other hand—think salmon, avocados, nuts, and vegetable oils—has been shown in a recent study to result in twice as much weight loss as seen in those assigned to low-fat diets. \"It\\'s a double-whammy for weight gain,\" one researcher tells NPR. \"We\\'ve been told for decades that if you don\\'t want fat on your body, don\\'t put fat into your body.

The \"overload of solemnity\" and \"self-important sobriety\" was part of the problem, but the \"labored filler segments\" were also pretty bad—especially considering they were the reason the \"award recipients were played off virtually as soon as they began speaking.\" Even a long-overdue best drama win for Breaking Bad couldn\\'t save this \"plodding, lifeless, and just plain glum\" show. Everyone agrees, however, Merritt Wever\\'s acceptance speech was a total highlight.',\n"," '– A one-of-a-kind dime minted in 1873 sold for $1.6 million at a Philadelphia auction last night, reports AP. The coin depicts a seated Lady Liberty, and it is thought to be the lone survivor from a one-day minting of dimes at the renowned (in coin circles, anyway) mint in Carson City, Nevada. Another 110 coins also went up for auction, one of each coin minted in Carson City before its facility closed in 1893. Total haul: $10 million. Total face value of the coins: About $600, according to USA Today, which has more explanation on why collectors were so bowled over.',\n"," '– Feel like monogamy is keeping you from an exciting sex life? Take note: An open relationship, with the potential for more sexual partners, does not necessarily mean you\\'ll be more sexually satisfied. That\\'s according to a survey of more than 11,000 people from 28 European countries, aged 18 to 65. In the survey conducted by German research company Dalia in March, 82% of monogamous couples and 80% of married couples reported that they were sexually satisfied, compared to 71% of couples in an open or polyamorous relationship and fewer than half of singles, reports Quartz. Other than singles who are \"looking,\" those in open relationships were actually the most likely to be unsatisfied sexually. Some 22% said they weren\\'t sexually satisfied, compared to 12% of married participants and 11% of monogamous respondents. Interestingly, a University of Michigan survey of some 2,000 people over 25, published in March, found heterosexuals in open relationships were significantly less satisfied with their relationship overall than those in monogamous relationships, reported Michigan Live. On the flip side, though, those in polyamorous relationships reported having higher levels of trust and lower levels of jealousy than their monogamous counterparts. That left researchers to conclude that there is \"no net benefit of one relationship style over another.\" (Americans appear to be having trouble in the bedroom.)',\n"," '– A member of the anti-government sovereign-citizen movement staged what amounted to a one-man assault today on the courthouse in Forsyth County, Georgia, reports the Atlanta Journal-Constitution. But Dennis Marx never made it inside. After opening fire from his pickup, he was shot to death by deputies in a shootout that lasted about 90 seconds, reports CNN. One deputy got shot in the leg but will survive. Marx threw some kind of grenades during his assault, along with \"spike strips\" apparently intended to keep other vehicles from responding. He also had an assault rifle, a gas mask, a bullet-proof vest, and chillingly, flex ties and water. Those last two suggest he intended to take hostages inside the building. “He came for the purpose of occupying the courthouse,” says Forsyth Sheriff Duane Piper. The sheriff says Marx might have been successful if not for a deputy—the one who got shot—who spotted the gunman as soon as he drove up and engaged him. The situation \"was solved (with) that deputy\\'s actions,\" he says. Marx had been due in court this morning on marijuana and weapons charges, reports WSB-TV. Piper says Marx\\'s home is a \"bomb\" rigged with booby traps, and it will take some time to clear it.']"]},"metadata":{},"execution_count":12}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"xHDcxkcWiDLZ"},"source":["# Text Generation"]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"Y7hJ0DYxGAaL","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1629641568934,"user_tz":-480,"elapsed":3875,"user":{"displayName":"Lin Qiwei","photoUrl":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AOh14Gg7Y5XhKXvLeCQIWyx0AC4rGepdGbRR1Wm8LkA61A=s64","userId":"12577342240101728853"}},"outputId":"d11df4b8-d026-48b7-8d6f-5c6808dff065"},"source":["model = AutoModelForSeq2SeqLM.from_pretrained(\"/content/drive/MyDrive/Summarization/LED\")"],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","text":["loading configuration file /content/drive/MyDrive/Summarization/LED/config.json\n","Model config LEDConfig {\n","  \"_name_or_path\": \"allenai/led-base-16384\",\n","  \"activation_dropout\": 0.0,\n","  \"activation_function\": \"gelu\",\n","  \"architectures\": [\n","    \"LEDForConditionalGeneration\"\n","  ],\n","  \"attention_dropout\": 0.0,\n","  \"attention_window\": [\n","    1024,\n","    1024,\n","    1024,\n","    1024,\n","    1024,\n","    1024\n","  ],\n","  \"bos_token_id\": 0,\n","  \"classif_dropout\": 0.0,\n","  \"classifier_dropout\": 0.0,\n","  \"d_model\": 768,\n","  \"decoder_attention_heads\": 12,\n","  \"decoder_ffn_dim\": 3072,\n","  \"decoder_layerdrop\": 0.0,\n","  \"decoder_layers\": 6,\n","  \"decoder_start_token_id\": 2,\n","  \"dropout\": 0.1,\n","  \"encoder_attention_heads\": 12,\n","  \"encoder_ffn_dim\": 3072,\n","  \"encoder_layerdrop\": 0.0,\n","  \"encoder_layers\": 6,\n","  \"eos_token_id\": 2,\n","  \"gradient_checkpointing\": true,\n","  \"id2label\": {\n","    \"0\": \"LABEL_0\",\n","    \"1\": \"LABEL_1\",\n","    \"2\": \"LABEL_2\"\n","  },\n","  \"init_std\": 0.02,\n","  \"is_encoder_decoder\": true,\n","  \"label2id\": {\n","    \"LABEL_0\": 0,\n","    \"LABEL_1\": 1,\n","    \"LABEL_2\": 2\n","  },\n","  \"max_decoder_position_embeddings\": 1024,\n","  \"max_encoder_position_embeddings\": 16384,\n","  \"model_type\": \"led\",\n","  \"num_hidden_layers\": 6,\n","  \"pad_token_id\": 1,\n","  \"torch_dtype\": \"float32\",\n","  \"transformers_version\": \"4.9.2\",\n","  \"use_cache\": false,\n","  \"vocab_size\": 50265\n","}\n","\n","loading weights file /content/drive/MyDrive/Summarization/LED/pytorch_model.bin\n","All model checkpoint weights were used when initializing LEDForConditionalGeneration.\n","\n","All the weights of LEDForConditionalGeneration were initialized from the model checkpoint at /content/drive/MyDrive/Summarization/LED.\n","If your task is similar to the task the model of the checkpoint was trained on, you can already use LEDForConditionalGeneration for predictions without further training.\n"],"name":"stderr"}]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"luXa9Ye2l_o6","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1629641583683,"user_tz":-480,"elapsed":526,"user":{"displayName":"Lin Qiwei","photoUrl":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AOh14Gg7Y5XhKXvLeCQIWyx0AC4rGepdGbRR1Wm8LkA61A=s64","userId":"12577342240101728853"}},"outputId":"627797ae-824a-48be-d037-1048e438e129"},"source":["ARTICLE = data['test']['document'][0]\n","\n","ARTICLE"],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"application/vnd.google.colaboratory.intrinsic+json":{"type":"string"},"text/plain":["'GOP Eyes Gains As Voters In 11 States Pick Governors \\n  \\n Enlarge this image toggle caption Jim Cole/AP Jim Cole/AP \\n  \\n Voters in 11 states will pick their governors tonight, and Republicans appear on track to increase their numbers by at least one, with the potential to extend their hold to more than two-thirds of the nation\\'s top state offices. \\n  \\n Eight of the gubernatorial seats up for grabs are now held by Democrats; three are in Republican hands.
