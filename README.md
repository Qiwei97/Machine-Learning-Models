# Machine-Learning-Models

This Repository contains various machine learning models for Natural Language Processing and Image Classification.

The Image Classification Model is mainly implemented via Tensorflow and Keras. (GPU compatible)
There are 3 different implementations for Sentiment Analysis using different libraries, namely Tensorflow (TPU compatible), Pytorch (TPU compatible) and the Huggingface Trainer API.
